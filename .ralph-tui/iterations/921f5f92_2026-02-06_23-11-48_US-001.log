During the setup process, you will be prompted to choose the project type, and it's essential to select the `Next.js (Monorepo)` option. This action will automatically configure a new monorepo project, establishing two distinct workspaces: `web` for your application and `ui` for shared components, alongside setting up [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as the default build system. With this configuration, your environment is ready, allowing you to seamlessly begin adding components to your project, noting that this monorepo setup utilizes React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### May 2025 - New Site\n\nSource: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog/2025-05-new-site\n\nWe've upgraded [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com) to Next.js 15.3 and Tailwind v4. The site now uses the upgraded `new-york` components. We've also made some minor design updates to make the site faster and easier to navigate. This upgrade unlocks a lot of new features that we're working on. More to come."}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f7da325-e0f4-496d-8a22-49e3d62110a8","uuid":"85c227d1-35c7-4455-a33e-8dc5541010b2","tool_use_result":[{"type":"text","text":"### Initialize shadcn/ui Project with Next.js\n\nSource: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next\n\nInitialize a new Next.js project or configure an existing one with shadcn/ui using the init command.

During the setup process, you will be prompted to choose the project type, and it's essential to select the `Next.js (Monorepo)` option. This action will automatically configure a new monorepo project, establishing two distinct workspaces: `web` for your application and `ui` for shared components, alongside setting up [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as the default build system. With this configuration, your environment is ready, allowing you to seamlessly begin adding components to your project, noting that this monorepo setup utilizes React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### May 2025 - New Site\n\nSource: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog/2025-05-new-site\n\nWe've upgraded [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com) to Next.js 15.3 and Tailwind v4. The site now uses the upgraded `new-york` components. We've also made some minor design updates to make the site faster and easier to navigate. This upgrade unlocks a lot of new features that we're working on. More to come."}]}
