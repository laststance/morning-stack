No `tailwind.config.ts` exists.\n     9→- **shadcn/ui v3.8+**: Uses `components.json` at root, components go in `src/components/ui/`. CSS path is `src/app/globals.css`. Import utils from `@/lib/utils`.\n    10→- **ESLint 9 flat config**: Configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` using `defineConfig()` from `eslint/config`. Includes `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`, `eslint-config-next/typescript`, and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n    11→- **Dark-first theme**: `<html className=\"dark\">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Dark theme uses PRD palette (#0D0D0D bg, #FF6B35 accent). Light theme retains shadcn neutral defaults.\n    12→- **PRD custom tokens**: Available as `ms-bg-primary`, `ms-bg-secondary`, `ms-bg-tertiary`, `ms-text-primary`, `ms-text-secondary`, `ms-text-muted`, `ms-accent`, `ms-border` in Tailwind classes.\n    13→- **Fonts**: Inter (latin, `--font-inter`) + Noto Sans JP (japanese, `--font-noto-sans-jp`) via `next/font/google`. Font CSS var mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.\n    14→- **Quality gates**: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`\n    15→- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` with `@neondatabase/serverless`. Config at `drizzle.config.ts`. Migrations output to `supabase/migrations/`.\n    16→- **DB scripts**: `pnpm db:generate` (create migration SQL), `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:push` (dev push without migration files).\n    17→- **Auth.js v5**: Config in `src/lib/auth.ts`, exports `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }`. Uses `@auth/drizzle-adapter` with custom table mappings. Route handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. Middleware at `src/middleware.ts` protects `/bookmarks` and `/settings`. `SessionProvider` in `src/components/session-provider.tsx` wraps root layout. Login page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`. Env vars: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`.\n    18→- **DB connection fallback**: `src/lib/db/index.ts` uses placeholder URL when `DATABASE_URL` is unset to prevent build-time failures during static page generation.\n    19→- **Redux Toolkit**: Store factory in `src/lib/store.ts` (`makeStore()`), typed hooks in `src/lib/hooks.ts` (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`). Slices in `src/lib/features/`. `StoreProvider` in `src/components/store-provider.tsx` wraps root layout (outside `SessionProvider`). Uses `useState(makeStore)` pattern instead of `useRef` to avoid React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` lint error.\n    20→- **Upstash Redis cache**: `src/lib/cache.ts` exports `cacheGet<T>(key)` and `cacheSet(key, value, ttl)`. Conditional Redis init (null stub when env vars missing) for build-time safety. All source modules use cache key prefix `source:` (e.g. `source:hackernews`).\n    21→- **Data source modules**: Each source in `src/lib/sources/{name}.ts` exports a single `fetch{Name}Articles(): Promise<Article[]>` function. Uses cache-first + stale-cache-fallback pattern. Returns `Article[]` from `@/types/article`.\n    22→- **Article type**: `src/types/article.ts` defines shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` union type.

PRD says \"15\" but latest is 16. Used latest.\n    44→  - shadcn init with `--base-color neutral` moves `src/app/` to `app/` at root. Must move back to `src/app/` after init.\n    45→  - `components.json` CSS path must be updated to `src/app/globals.css` after moving app dir back.\n    46→  - Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color model for CSS variables. PRD hex values converted: `#0D0D0D` → `oklch(0.159 0 0)`, `#FF6B35` → `oklch(0.705 0.193 39.231)`.\n    47→  - `--style` flag removed from shadcn CLI in v3.8+; new-york is the default.\n    48→  - ESLint 9 uses `defineConfig()` and `globalIgnores()` from `eslint/config`.\n    49→  - `--no-react-compiler` flag needed for non-interactive create-next-app.\n    50→---\n    51→\n    52→## 2026-02-06 - US-002\n    53→- What was implemented: Complete Drizzle ORM schema with 7 tables (users, editions, articles, bookmarks, hidden_items, weather_cache, stock_cache), 5 PostgreSQL enums, typed relations, Neon HTTP database connection, and migration generation\n    54→- Files changed:\n    55→  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - All table definitions, enums, and relations with JSDoc\n    56→  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Drizzle instance with Neon HTTP driver and schema binding\n    57→  - `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit config pointing to schema and supabase/migrations output\n    58→  - `package.json` - Added `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push` scripts; added `drizzle-kit` devDep\n    59→  - `supabase/migrations/0000_nifty_blob.sql` - Generated initial migration with all tables, enums, FKs, and unique index\n    60→  - `supabase/migrations/meta/` - Drizzle Kit snapshot and journal metadata\n    61→- **Learnings:**\n    62→  - Drizzle v0.45+ uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` adapter with `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` for HTTP-mode connections (one HTTP request per query, no persistent connection pool — ideal for Vercel serverless).\n    63→  - `pgEnum` values must be defined before table references. Drizzle handles ordering in generated SQL.\n    64→  - `uuid().defaultRandom()` maps to `gen_random_uuid()` in PostgreSQL — built-in, no extension needed.\n    65→  - `date()` with `{ mode: \"string\" }` stores as PostgreSQL `date` type but returns `string` in TypeScript (e.g., \"2026-02-06\"), avoiding timezone issues.\n    66→  - Bookmarks unique constraint uses `uniqueIndex()` in the third-arg callback of `pgTable` — Drizzle v0.45 uses array syntax `(table) => [...]`.\n    67→  - `drizzle-kit generate` creates migration SQL + snapshot JSON. The `out` config must match where migrations are stored.\n    68→---\n    69→\n    70→## 2026-02-06 - US-003\n    71→- What was implemented: Full Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) integration with Google and GitHub OAuth providers, Drizzle adapter for database session persistence, login page, auth middleware, SessionProvider wrapper, and header with auth state display\n    72→- Files changed:\n    73→  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth.js v5 config with Google/GitHub providers, Drizzle adapter with custom table mappings, `/login` as custom signIn page\n    74→  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` tables for Auth.js; changed `users.id` from `uuid` to `text` for Auth.js compatibility; renamed `avatarUrl` → `image`, added `emailVerified`; updated `bookmarks.userId` and `hiddenItems.userId` from `uuid` to `text`; added `accountsRelations` and `sessionsRelations`\n    75→  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Added placeholder DATABASE_URL fallback for build-time safety\n    76→  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth.js catch-all route handler\n    77→  - `src/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware protecting `/bookmarks` and `/settings`, redirects to `/login` with `callbackUrl`\n    78→  - `src/components/session-provider.tsx` - Client-side SessionProvider wrapper\n    79→  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with GitHub and Google OAuth buttons, styled with PRD tokens\n    80→  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Server Component header with user avatar/name when logged in, Login button when not, sign-out action\n    81→  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `SessionProvider` wrapper and `Header` component\n    82→  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - shadcn/ui button component (added via CLI)\n    83→  - `package.json` - Added `@auth/core` and `@auth/drizzle-adapter` dependencies\n    84→  - `supabase/migrations/0000_cold_morbius.sql` - Regenerated migration with all Auth.js tables\n    85→- **Learnings:**\n    86→  - Auth.js v5 Drizzle adapter requires `text` PKs on the `users` table (not `uuid`). It also expects `image` (not `avatarUrl`) and `emailVerified` columns. Custom table mappings via `usersTable`, `accountsTable`, `sessionsTable`, `verificationTokensTable` options.\n    87→  - Auth.js v5 auto-detects env vars by convention: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for GitHub, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`/`AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` for Google. No need to pass `clientId`/`clientSecret` manually.\n    88→  - `NextAuth()` is called at module top level, which eagerly initializes the Drizzle adapter. If `DATABASE_URL` is missing at build time, `neon()` throws. Solution: provide a placeholder URL fallback in `db/index.ts` — it's never actually queried during build, only satisfies the constructor.\n    89→  - `drizzle-kit generate` is interactive when detecting column renames (e.g., `avatar_url` → `image`). Cleanest workaround: delete old migrations and regenerate from scratch if schema shape changes significantly.\n    90→  - Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for `middleware.ts` — it recommends `proxy` convention instead. However, Auth.js v5 still uses `middleware.ts` and it works fine; the warning is non-blocking.\n    91→  - Server Actions (`\"use server\"` inside form actions) work well for OAuth sign-in/sign-out — no client-side JS needed for the OAuth redirect.\n    92→---\n    93→\n    94→## 2026-02-06 - US-004\n    95→- What was implemented: Redux Toolkit store setup with editionSlice (morning/evening type + date), uiSlice (theme, sidebar, share menu), typed hooks, and StoreProvider integrated into root layout\n    96→- Files changed:\n    97→  - `src/lib/store.ts` - Store factory with `makeStore()`, `AppStore`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch` types\n    98→  - `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Pre-typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`\n    99→  - `src/lib/features/edition-slice.ts` - Edition type (morning/evening) and date state management\n   100→  - `src/lib/features/ui-slice.ts` - Theme, sidebar open, share menu article ID state management\n   101→  - `src/components/store-provider.tsx` - Client component wrapping app with Redux Provider\n   102→  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `StoreProvider` wrapping `SessionProvider`\n   103→- **Learnings:**\n   104→  - React 19 / React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` ESLint rule forbids accessing `ref.current` during render, even for the RTK-recommended `useRef` store pattern. The `== null` guard is accepted for initialization, but any subsequent `ref.current` access in the render body is flagged. Workaround: use `useState(makeStore)` with lazy initializer instead of `useRef`.\n   105→  - RTK's `withTypes<>()` pattern (e.g., `useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()`) is the recommended way to create typed hooks in RTK v2.x — cleaner than the old `TypedUseSelectorHook` generic.\n   106→  - `StoreProvider` wraps `SessionProvider` in the layout tree so all auth-consuming components also have access to Redux state.\n   107→---\n   108→\n   109→## 2026-02-06 - US-005\n   110→- What was implemented: HackerNews data source integration with typed fetch function, Upstash Redis caching module, and shared Article type definition\n   111→- Files changed:\n   112→  - `src/types/article.ts` - Shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` type used by all data sources\n   113→  - `src/lib/cache.ts` - Generic `cacheGet<T>()` / `cacheSet()` wrappers around Upstash Redis with build-time safety (null stub when env vars missing)\n   114→  - `src/lib/sources/hackernews.ts` - `fetchHackerNewsArticles()` fetching top 5 front-page stories from HN Algolia API with 1-hour Redis cache and stale-cache fallback on API failure\n   115→- **Learnings:**\n   116→  - Upstash Redis JS SDK (`@upstash/redis`) uses `Redis.fromEnv()` which reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` automatically. Same env-var convention pattern as Auth.js v5.\n   117→  - Upstash SDK auto-serializes/deserializes JSON — no manual `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` needed. `redis.get<T>(key)` returns typed objects directly.\n   118→  - Like the Neon DB client, Redis client must handle missing env vars during `next build`. Solution: conditional initialization (`redis = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL ? Redis.fromEnv() : null`) with null-guard in cache functions.\n   119→  - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit. Some stories (Ask HN, Show HN text posts) have `url: null` — must fallback to `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=` permalink.\n   120→  - `Article` type is intentionally decoupled from Drizzle's `InferSelectModel` — the fetch layer produces plain objects that are later persisted by the edition builder (US-015).\n   121→---\n   122→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

No `tailwind.config.ts` exists.\n- **shadcn/ui v3.8+**: Uses `components.json` at root, components go in `src/components/ui/`. CSS path is `src/app/globals.css`.

Includes `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`, `eslint-config-next/typescript`, and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n- **Dark-first theme**: `<html className=\"dark\">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Dark theme uses PRD palette (#0D0D0D bg, #FF6B35 accent). Light theme retains shadcn neutral defaults.\n- **PRD custom tokens**: Available as `ms-bg-primary`, `ms-bg-secondary`, `ms-bg-tertiary`, `ms-text-primary`, `ms-text-secondary`, `ms-text-muted`, `ms-accent`, `ms-border` in Tailwind classes.\n- **Fonts**: Inter (latin, `--font-inter`) + Noto Sans JP (japanese, `--font-noto-sans-jp`) via `next/font/google`. Font CSS var mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.\n- **Quality gates**: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` with `@neondatabase/serverless`. Config at `drizzle.config.ts`. Migrations output to `supabase/migrations/`.\n- **DB scripts**: `pnpm db:generate` (create migration SQL), `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:push` (dev push without migration files).\n- **Auth.js v5**: Config in `src/lib/auth.ts`, exports `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }`.

PRD hex values converted: `#0D0D0D` → `oklch(0.159 0 0)`, `#FF6B35` → `oklch(0.705 0.193 39.231)`.\n  - `--style` flag removed from shadcn CLI in v3.8+; new-york is the default.\n  - ESLint 9 uses `defineConfig()` and `globalIgnores()` from `eslint/config`.\n  - `--no-react-compiler` flag needed for non-interactive create-next-app.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-002\n- What was implemented: Complete Drizzle ORM schema with 7 tables (users, editions, articles, bookmarks, hidden_items, weather_cache, stock_cache), 5 PostgreSQL enums, typed relations, Neon HTTP database connection, and migration generation\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - All table definitions, enums, and relations with JSDoc\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Drizzle instance with Neon HTTP driver and schema binding\n  - `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit config pointing to schema and supabase/migrations output\n  - `package.json` - Added `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push` scripts; added `drizzle-kit` devDep\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_nifty_blob.sql` - Generated initial migration with all tables, enums, FKs, and unique index\n  - `supabase/migrations/meta/` - Drizzle Kit snapshot and journal metadata\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Drizzle v0.45+ uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` adapter with `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` for HTTP-mode connections (one HTTP request per query, no persistent connection pool — ideal for Vercel serverless).\n  - `pgEnum` values must be defined before table references. Drizzle handles ordering in generated SQL.\n  - `uuid().defaultRandom()` maps to `gen_random_uuid()` in PostgreSQL — built-in, no extension needed.\n  - `date()` with `{ mode: \"string\" }` stores as PostgreSQL `date` type but returns `string` in TypeScript (e.g., \"2026-02-06\"), avoiding timezone issues.\n  - Bookmarks unique constraint uses `uniqueIndex()` in the third-arg callback of `pgTable` — Drizzle v0.45 uses array syntax `(table) => [...]`.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` creates migration SQL + snapshot JSON. The `out` config must match where migrations are stored.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-003\n- What was implemented: Full Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) integration with Google and GitHub OAuth providers, Drizzle adapter for database session persistence, login page, auth middleware, SessionProvider wrapper, and header with auth state display\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth.js v5 config with Google/GitHub providers, Drizzle adapter with custom table mappings, `/login` as custom signIn page\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` tables for Auth.js; changed `users.id` from `uuid` to `text` for Auth.js compatibility; renamed `avatarUrl` → `image`, added `emailVerified`; updated `bookmarks.userId` and `hiddenItems.userId` from `uuid` to `text`; added `accountsRelations` and `sessionsRelations`\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Added placeholder DATABASE_URL fallback for build-time safety\n  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth.js catch-all route handler\n  - `src/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware protecting `/bookmarks` and `/settings`, redirects to `/login` with `callbackUrl`\n  - `src/components/session-provider.tsx` - Client-side SessionProvider wrapper\n  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with GitHub and Google OAuth buttons, styled with PRD tokens\n  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Server Component header with user avatar/name when logged in, Login button when not, sign-out action\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `SessionProvider` wrapper and `Header` component\n  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - shadcn/ui button component (added via CLI)\n  - `package.json` - Added `@auth/core` and `@auth/drizzle-adapter` dependencies\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_cold_morbius.sql` - Regenerated migration with all Auth.js tables\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Auth.js v5 Drizzle adapter requires `text` PKs on the `users` table (not `uuid`). It also expects `image` (not `avatarUrl`) and `emailVerified` columns. Custom table mappings via `usersTable`, `accountsTable`, `sessionsTable`, `verificationTokensTable` options.\n  - Auth.js v5 auto-detects env vars by convention: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for GitHub, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`/`AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` for Google. No need to pass `clientId`/`clientSecret` manually.\n  - `NextAuth()` is called at module top level, which eagerly initializes the Drizzle adapter. If `DATABASE_URL` is missing at build time, `neon()` throws. Solution: provide a placeholder URL fallback in `db/index.ts` — it's never actually queried during build, only satisfies the constructor.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` is interactive when detecting column renames (e.g., `avatar_url` → `image`). Cleanest workaround: delete old migrations and regenerate from scratch if schema shape changes significantly.\n  - Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for `middleware.ts` — it recommends `proxy` convention instead. However, Auth.js v5 still uses `middleware.ts` and it works fine; the warning is non-blocking.\n  - Server Actions (`\"use server\"` inside form actions) work well for OAuth sign-in/sign-out — no client-side JS needed for the OAuth redirect.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-004\n- What was implemented: Redux Toolkit store setup with editionSlice (morning/evening type + date), uiSlice (theme, sidebar, share menu), typed hooks, and StoreProvider integrated into root layout\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/store.ts` - Store factory with `makeStore()`, `AppStore`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch` types\n  - `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Pre-typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`\n  - `src/lib/features/edition-slice.ts` - Edition type (morning/evening) and date state management\n  - `src/lib/features/ui-slice.ts` - Theme, sidebar open, share menu article ID state management\n  - `src/components/store-provider.tsx` - Client component wrapping app with Redux Provider\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `StoreProvider` wrapping `SessionProvider`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - React 19 / React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` ESLint rule forbids accessing `ref.current` during render, even for the RTK-recommended `useRef` store pattern. The `== null` guard is accepted for initialization, but any subsequent `ref.current` access in the render body is flagged. Workaround: use `useState(makeStore)` with lazy initializer instead of `useRef`.\n  - RTK's `withTypes<>()` pattern (e.g., `useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()`) is the recommended way to create typed hooks in RTK v2.x — cleaner than the old `TypedUseSelectorHook` generic.\n  - `StoreProvider` wraps `SessionProvider` in the layout tree so all auth-consuming components also have access to Redux state.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-005\n- What was implemented: HackerNews data source integration with typed fetch function, Upstash Redis caching module, and shared Article type definition\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/types/article.ts` - Shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` type used by all data sources\n  - `src/lib/cache.ts` - Generic `cacheGet<T>()` / `cacheSet()` wrappers around Upstash Redis with build-time safety (null stub when env vars missing)\n  - `src/lib/sources/hackernews.ts` - `fetchHackerNewsArticles()` fetching top 5 front-page stories from HN Algolia API with 1-hour Redis cache and stale-cache fallback on API failure\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Upstash Redis JS SDK (`@upstash/redis`) uses `Redis.fromEnv()` which reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` automatically. Same env-var convention pattern as Auth.js v5.\n  - Upstash SDK auto-serializes/deserializes JSON — no manual `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` needed. `redis.get<T>(key)` returns typed objects directly.\n  - Like the Neon DB client, Redis client must handle missing env vars during `next build`. Solution: conditional initialization (`redis = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL ? Redis.fromEnv() : null`) with null-guard in cache functions.\n  - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit. Some stories (Ask HN, Show HN text posts) have `url: null` — must fallback to `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=` permalink.\n  - `Article` type is intentionally decoupled from Drizzle's `InferSelectModel` — the fetch layer produces plain objects that are later persisted by the edition builder (US-015).\n---\n","numLines":122,"startLine":1,"totalLines":122}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- **Tailwind v4 CSS-first config**: Design tokens are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using `@theme inline` and CSS custom properties with OKLCH color model. No `tailwind.config.ts` exists.\n- **shadcn/ui v3.8+**: Uses `components.json` at root, components go in `src/components/ui/`. CSS path is `src/app/globals.css`. Import utils from `@/lib/utils`.\n- **ESLint 9 flat config**: Configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` using `defineConfig()` from `eslint/config`. Includes `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`, `eslint-config-next/typescript`, and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n- **Dark-first theme**: `<html className=\"dark\">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Dark theme uses PRD palette (#0D0D0D bg, #FF6B35 accent). Light theme retains shadcn neutral defaults.\n- **PRD custom tokens**: Available as `ms-bg-primary`, `ms-bg-secondary`, `ms-bg-tertiary`, `ms-text-primary`, `ms-text-secondary`, `ms-text-muted`, `ms-accent`, `ms-border` in Tailwind classes.\n- **Fonts**: Inter (latin, `--font-inter`) + Noto Sans JP (japanese, `--font-noto-sans-jp`) via `next/font/google`. Font CSS var mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.\n- **Quality gates**: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` with `@neondatabase/serverless`. Config at `drizzle.config.ts`. Migrations output to `supabase/migrations/`.\n- **DB scripts**: `pnpm db:generate` (create migration SQL), `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:push` (dev push without migration files).\n- **Auth.js v5**: Config in `src/lib/auth.ts`, exports `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }`. Uses `@auth/drizzle-adapter` with custom table mappings. Route handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. Middleware at `src/middleware.ts` protects `/bookmarks` and `/settings`. `SessionProvider` in `src/components/session-provider.tsx` wraps root layout. Login page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`. Env vars: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`.\n- **DB connection fallback**: `src/lib/db/index.ts` uses placeholder URL when `DATABASE_URL` is unset to prevent build-time failures during static page generation.\n- **Redux Toolkit**: Store factory in `src/lib/store.ts` (`makeStore()`), typed hooks in `src/lib/hooks.ts` (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`). Slices in `src/lib/features/`. `StoreProvider` in `src/components/store-provider.tsx` wraps root layout (outside `SessionProvider`). Uses `useState(makeStore)` pattern instead of `useRef` to avoid React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` lint error.\n- **Upstash Redis cache**: `src/lib/cache.ts` exports `cacheGet<T>(key)` and `cacheSet(key, value, ttl)`. Conditional Redis init (null stub when env vars missing) for build-time safety. All source modules use cache key prefix `source:` (e.g. `source:hackernews`).\n- **Data source modules**: Each source in `src/lib/sources/{name}.ts` exports a single `fetch{Name}Articles(): Promise<Article[]>` function. Uses cache-first + stale-cache-fallback pattern. Returns `Article[]` from `@/types/article`.\n- **Article type**: `src/types/article.ts` defines shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` union type. Decoupled from Drizzle schema — fetch layer produces plain objects.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-001\n- What was implemented: Full project foundation with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Inter + Noto Sans JP fonts, ESLint 9 + Prettier, and PRD design tokens\n- Files changed:\n  - `package.json` - Project config with all dependencies\n  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config with `@/*` path alias\n  - `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint 9 flat config with Prettier\n  - `.prettierrc` - Prettier config with Tailwind plugin\n  - `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS with @tailwindcss/postcss\n  - `next.config.ts` - Next.js config\n  - `components.json` - shadcn/ui config\n  - `src/app/globals.css` - Tailwind v4 design tokens with PRD palette (OKLCH)\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with fonts and dark class\n  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Placeholder home page\n  - `src/lib/utils.ts` - shadcn cn() utility\n  - `.gitignore` - Added CLAUDE.md\n  - Created dirs: `src/components/ui/`, `src/types/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `tests/`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `create-next-app@latest` (Feb 2026) generates Next.js 16.1.6, not 15. PRD says \"15\" but latest is 16. Used latest.\n  - shadcn init with `--base-color neutral` moves `src/app/` to `app/` at root. Must move back to `src/app/` after init.\n  - `components.json` CSS path must be updated to `src/app/globals.css` after moving app dir back.\n  - Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color model for CSS variables. PRD hex values converted: `#0D0D0D` → `oklch(0.159 0 0)`, `#FF6B35` → `oklch(0.705 0.193 39.231)`.\n  - `--style` flag removed from shadcn CLI in v3.8+; new-york is the default.\n  - ESLint 9 uses `defineConfig()` and `globalIgnores()` from `eslint/config`.\n  - `--no-react-compiler` flag needed for non-interactive create-next-app.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-002\n- What was implemented: Complete Drizzle ORM schema with 7 tables (users, editions, articles, bookmarks, hidden_items, weather_cache, stock_cache), 5 PostgreSQL enums, typed relations, Neon HTTP database connection, and migration generation\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - All table definitions, enums, and relations with JSDoc\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Drizzle instance with Neon HTTP driver and schema binding\n  - `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit config pointing to schema and supabase/migrations output\n  - `package.json` - Added `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push` scripts; added `drizzle-kit` devDep\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_nifty_blob.sql` - Generated initial migration with all tables, enums, FKs, and unique index\n  - `supabase/migrations/meta/` - Drizzle Kit snapshot and journal metadata\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Drizzle v0.45+ uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` adapter with `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` for HTTP-mode connections (one HTTP request per query, no persistent connection pool — ideal for Vercel serverless).\n  - `pgEnum` values must be defined before table references. Drizzle handles ordering in generated SQL.\n  - `uuid().defaultRandom()` maps to `gen_random_uuid()` in PostgreSQL — built-in, no extension needed.\n  - `date()` with `{ mode: \"string\" }` stores as PostgreSQL `date` type but returns `string` in TypeScript (e.g., \"2026-02-06\"), avoiding timezone issues.\n  - Bookmarks unique constraint uses `uniqueIndex()` in the third-arg callback of `pgTable` — Drizzle v0.45 uses array syntax `(table) => [...]`.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` creates migration SQL + snapshot JSON. The `out` config must match where migrations are stored.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-003\n- What was implemented: Full Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) integration with Google and GitHub OAuth providers, Drizzle adapter for database session persistence, login page, auth middleware, SessionProvider wrapper, and header with auth state display\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth.js v5 config with Google/GitHub providers, Drizzle adapter with custom table mappings, `/login` as custom signIn page\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` tables for Auth.js; changed `users.id` from `uuid` to `text` for Auth.js compatibility; renamed `avatarUrl` → `image`, added `emailVerified`; updated `bookmarks.userId` and `hiddenItems.userId` from `uuid` to `text`; added `accountsRelations` and `sessionsRelations`\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Added placeholder DATABASE_URL fallback for build-time safety\n  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth.js catch-all route handler\n  - `src/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware protecting `/bookmarks` and `/settings`, redirects to `/login` with `callbackUrl`\n  - `src/components/session-provider.tsx` - Client-side SessionProvider wrapper\n  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with GitHub and Google OAuth buttons, styled with PRD tokens\n  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Server Component header with user avatar/name when logged in, Login button when not, sign-out action\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `SessionProvider` wrapper and `Header` component\n  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - shadcn/ui button component (added via CLI)\n  - `package.json` - Added `@auth/core` and `@auth/drizzle-adapter` dependencies\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_cold_morbius.sql` - Regenerated migration with all Auth.js tables\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Auth.js v5 Drizzle adapter requires `text` PKs on the `users` table (not `uuid`). It also expects `image` (not `avatarUrl`) and `emailVerified` columns. Custom table mappings via `usersTable`, `accountsTable`, `sessionsTable`, `verificationTokensTable` options.\n  - Auth.js v5 auto-detects env vars by convention: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for GitHub, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`/`AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` for Google. No need to pass `clientId`/`clientSecret` manually.\n  - `NextAuth()` is called at module top level, which eagerly initializes the Drizzle adapter. If `DATABASE_URL` is missing at build time, `neon()` throws. Solution: provide a placeholder URL fallback in `db/index.ts` — it's never actually queried during build, only satisfies the constructor.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` is interactive when detecting column renames (e.g., `avatar_url` → `image`). Cleanest workaround: delete old migrations and regenerate from scratch if schema shape changes significantly.\n  - Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for `middleware.ts` — it recommends `proxy` convention instead. However, Auth.js v5 still uses `middleware.ts` and it works fine; the warning is non-blocking.\n  - Server Actions (`\"use server\"` inside form actions) work well for OAuth sign-in/sign-out — no client-side JS needed for the OAuth redirect.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-004\n- What was implemented: Redux Toolkit store setup with editionSlice (morning/evening type + date), uiSlice (theme, sidebar, share menu), typed hooks, and StoreProvider integrated into root layout\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/store.ts` - Store factory with `makeStore()`, `AppStore`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch` types\n  - `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Pre-typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`\n  - `src/lib/features/edition-slice.ts` - Edition type (morning/evening) and date state management\n  - `src/lib/features/ui-slice.ts` - Theme, sidebar open, share menu article ID state management\n  - `src/components/store-provider.tsx` - Client component wrapping app with Redux Provider\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `StoreProvider` wrapping `SessionProvider`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - React 19 / React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` ESLint rule forbids accessing `ref.current` during render, even for the RTK-recommended `useRef` store pattern. The `== null` guard is accepted for initialization, but any subsequent `ref.current` access in the render body is flagged. Workaround: use `useState(makeStore)` with lazy initializer instead of `useRef`.\n  - RTK's `withTypes<>()` pattern (e.g., `useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()`) is the recommended way to create typed hooks in RTK v2.x — cleaner than the old `TypedUseSelectorHook` generic.\n  - `StoreProvider` wraps `SessionProvider` in the layout tree so all auth-consuming components also have access to Redux state.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-005\n- What was implemented: HackerNews data source integration with typed fetch function, Upstash Redis caching module, and shared Article type definition\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/types/article.ts` - Shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` type used by all data sources\n  - `src/lib/cache.ts` - Generic `cacheGet<T>()` / `cacheSet()` wrappers around Upstash Redis with build-time safety (null stub when env vars missing)\n  - `src/lib/sources/hackernews.ts` - `fetchHackerNewsArticles()` fetching top 5 front-page stories from HN Algolia API with 1-hour Redis cache and stale-cache fallback on API failure\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Upstash Redis JS SDK (`@upstash/redis`) uses `Redis.fromEnv()` which reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` automatically. Same env-var convention pattern as Auth.js v5.\n  - Upstash SDK auto-serializes/deserializes JSON — no manual `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` needed. `redis.get<T>(key)` returns typed objects directly.\n  - Like the Neon DB client, Redis client must handle missing env vars during `next build`. Solution: conditional initialization (`redis = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL ? Redis.fromEnv() : null`) with null-guard in cache functions.\n  - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit. Some stories (Ask HN, Show HN text posts) have `url: null` — must fallback to `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=` permalink.\n  - `Article` type is intentionally decoupled from Drizzle's `InferSelectModel` — the fetch layer produces plain objects that are later persisted by the edition builder (US-015).\n---\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":119,"oldLines":3,"newStart":119,"newLines":15,"lines":["   - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit.
