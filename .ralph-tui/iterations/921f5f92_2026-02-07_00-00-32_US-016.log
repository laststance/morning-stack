No `tailwind.config.ts` exists.\n     9→- **shadcn/ui v3.8+**: Uses `components.json` at root, components go in `src/components/ui/`. CSS path is `src/app/globals.css`. Import utils from `@/lib/utils`.\n    10→- **ESLint 9 flat config**: Configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` using `defineConfig()` from `eslint/config`. Includes `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`, `eslint-config-next/typescript`, and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n    11→- **Dark-first theme**: `<html className=\"dark\">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Dark theme uses PRD palette (#0D0D0D bg, #FF6B35 accent). Light theme retains shadcn neutral defaults.\n    12→- **PRD custom tokens**: Available as `ms-bg-primary`, `ms-bg-secondary`, `ms-bg-tertiary`, `ms-text-primary`, `ms-text-secondary`, `ms-text-muted`, `ms-accent`, `ms-border` in Tailwind classes.\n    13→- **Fonts**: Inter (latin, `--font-inter`) + Noto Sans JP (japanese, `--font-noto-sans-jp`) via `next/font/google`. Font CSS var mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.\n    14→- **Quality gates**: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`\n    15→- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` with `@neondatabase/serverless`. Config at `drizzle.config.ts`. Migrations output to `supabase/migrations/`.\n    16→- **DB scripts**: `pnpm db:generate` (create migration SQL), `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:push` (dev push without migration files).\n    17→- **Auth.js v5**: Config in `src/lib/auth.ts`, exports `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }`. Uses `@auth/drizzle-adapter` with custom table mappings. Route handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. Middleware at `src/middleware.ts` protects `/bookmarks` and `/settings`. `SessionProvider` in `src/components/session-provider.tsx` wraps root layout. Login page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`. Env vars: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`.\n    18→- **DB connection fallback**: `src/lib/db/index.ts` uses placeholder URL when `DATABASE_URL` is unset to prevent build-time failures during static page generation.\n    19→- **Redux Toolkit**: Store factory in `src/lib/store.ts` (`makeStore()`), typed hooks in `src/lib/hooks.ts` (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`). Slices in `src/lib/features/`. `StoreProvider` in `src/components/store-provider.tsx` wraps root layout (outside `SessionProvider`). Uses `useState(makeStore)` pattern instead of `useRef` to avoid React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` lint error.\n    20→- **Upstash Redis cache**: `src/lib/cache.ts` exports `cacheGet<T>(key)` and `cacheSet(key, value, ttl)`. Conditional Redis init (null stub when env vars missing) for build-time safety. All source modules use cache key prefix `source:` (e.g. `source:hackernews`).\n    21→- **Data source modules**: Each source in `src/lib/sources/{name}.ts` exports a single `fetch{Name}Articles(): Promise<Article[]>` function. Uses cache-first + stale-cache-fallback pattern. Returns `Article[]` from `@/types/article`.\n    22→- **Article type**: `src/types/article.ts` defines shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` union type. Decoupled from Drizzle schema — fetch layer produces plain objects.\n    23→- **Cron collection**: `src/app/api/cron/collect/route.ts` handles edition building. Vercel Cron (UTC) fires at `0 21 * * *` (06:00 JST morning) and `0 8 * * *` (17:00 JST evening). Auth via `CRON_SECRET` Bearer token. Idempotent — skips if edition already exists for that type+date. Scores normalized to 0–100 using fixed source ranges.\n    24→\n    25→---\n    26→\n    27→## 2026-02-06 - US-001\n    28→- What was implemented: Full project foundation with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Inter + Noto Sans JP fonts, ESLint 9 + Prettier, and PRD design tokens\n    29→- Files changed:\n    30→  - `package.json` - Project config with all dependencies\n    31→  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config with `@/*` path alias\n    32→  - `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint 9 flat config with Prettier\n    33→  - `.prettierrc` - Prettier config with Tailwind plugin\n    34→  - `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS with @tailwindcss/postcss\n    35→  - `next.config.ts` - Next.js config\n    36→  - `components.json` - shadcn/ui config\n    37→  - `src/app/globals.css` - Tailwind v4 design tokens with PRD palette (OKLCH)\n    38→  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with fonts and dark class\n    39→  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Placeholder home page\n    40→  - `src/lib/utils.ts` - shadcn cn() utility\n    41→  - `.gitignore` - Added CLAUDE.md\n    42→  - Created dirs: `src/components/ui/`, `src/types/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `tests/`\n    43→- **Learnings:**\n    44→  - `create-next-app@latest` (Feb 2026) generates Next.js 16.1.6, not 15. PRD says \"15\" but latest is 16. Used latest.\n    45→  - shadcn init with `--base-color neutral` moves `src/app/` to `app/` at root. Must move back to `src/app/` after init.\n    46→  - `components.json` CSS path must be updated to `src/app/globals.css` after moving app dir back.\n    47→  - Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color model for CSS variables. PRD hex values converted: `#0D0D0D` → `oklch(0.159 0 0)`, `#FF6B35` → `oklch(0.705 0.193 39.231)`.\n    48→  - `--style` flag removed from shadcn CLI in v3.8+; new-york is the default.\n    49→  - ESLint 9 uses `defineConfig()` and `globalIgnores()` from `eslint/config`.\n    50→  - `--no-react-compiler` flag needed for non-interactive create-next-app.\n    51→---\n    52→\n    53→## 2026-02-06 - US-002\n    54→- What was implemented: Complete Drizzle ORM schema with 7 tables (users, editions, articles, bookmarks, hidden_items, weather_cache, stock_cache), 5 PostgreSQL enums, typed relations, Neon HTTP database connection, and migration generation\n    55→- Files changed:\n    56→  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - All table definitions, enums, and relations with JSDoc\n    57→  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Drizzle instance with Neon HTTP driver and schema binding\n    58→  - `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit config pointing to schema and supabase/migrations output\n    59→  - `package.json` - Added `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push` scripts; added `drizzle-kit` devDep\n    60→  - `supabase/migrations/0000_nifty_blob.sql` - Generated initial migration with all tables, enums, FKs, and unique index\n    61→  - `supabase/migrations/meta/` - Drizzle Kit snapshot and journal metadata\n    62→- **Learnings:**\n    63→  - Drizzle v0.45+ uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` adapter with `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` for HTTP-mode connections (one HTTP request per query, no persistent connection pool — ideal for Vercel serverless).\n    64→  - `pgEnum` values must be defined before table references. Drizzle handles ordering in generated SQL.\n    65→  - `uuid().defaultRandom()` maps to `gen_random_uuid()` in PostgreSQL — built-in, no extension needed.\n    66→  - `date()` with `{ mode: \"string\" }` stores as PostgreSQL `date` type but returns `string` in TypeScript (e.g., \"2026-02-06\"), avoiding timezone issues.\n    67→  - Bookmarks unique constraint uses `uniqueIndex()` in the third-arg callback of `pgTable` — Drizzle v0.45 uses array syntax `(table) => [...]`.\n    68→  - `drizzle-kit generate` creates migration SQL + snapshot JSON. The `out` config must match where migrations are stored.\n    69→---\n    70→\n    71→## 2026-02-06 - US-003\n    72→- What was implemented: Full Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) integration with Google and GitHub OAuth providers, Drizzle adapter for database session persistence, login page, auth middleware, SessionProvider wrapper, and header with auth state display\n    73→- Files changed:\n    74→  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth.js v5 config with Google/GitHub providers, Drizzle adapter with custom table mappings, `/login` as custom signIn page\n    75→  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` tables for Auth.js; changed `users.id` from `uuid` to `text` for Auth.js compatibility; renamed `avatarUrl` → `image`, added `emailVerified`; updated `bookmarks.userId` and `hiddenItems.userId` from `uuid` to `text`; added `accountsRelations` and `sessionsRelations`\n    76→  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Added placeholder DATABASE_URL fallback for build-time safety\n    77→  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth.js catch-all route handler\n    78→  - `src/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware protecting `/bookmarks` and `/settings`, redirects to `/login` with `callbackUrl`\n    79→  - `src/components/session-provider.tsx` - Client-side SessionProvider wrapper\n    80→  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with GitHub and Google OAuth buttons, styled with PRD tokens\n    81→  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Server Component header with user avatar/name when logged in, Login button when not, sign-out action\n    82→  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `SessionProvider` wrapper and `Header` component\n    83→  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - shadcn/ui button component (added via CLI)\n    84→  - `package.json` - Added `@auth/core` and `@auth/drizzle-adapter` dependencies\n    85→  - `supabase/migrations/0000_cold_morbius.sql` - Regenerated migration with all Auth.js tables\n    86→- **Learnings:**\n    87→  - Auth.js v5 Drizzle adapter requires `text` PKs on the `users` table (not `uuid`). It also expects `image` (not `avatarUrl`) and `emailVerified` columns. Custom table mappings via `usersTable`, `accountsTable`, `sessionsTable`, `verificationTokensTable` options.\n    88→  - Auth.js v5 auto-detects env vars by convention: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for GitHub, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`/`AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` for Google. No need to pass `clientId`/`clientSecret` manually.\n    89→  - `NextAuth()` is called at module top level, which eagerly initializes the Drizzle adapter. If `DATABASE_URL` is missing at build time, `neon()` throws. Solution: provide a placeholder URL fallback in `db/index.ts` — it's never actually queried during build, only satisfies the constructor.\n    90→  - `drizzle-kit generate` is interactive when detecting column renames (e.g., `avatar_url` → `image`). Cleanest workaround: delete old migrations and regenerate from scratch if schema shape changes significantly.\n    91→  - Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for `middleware.ts` — it recommends `proxy` convention instead. However, Auth.js v5 still uses `middleware.ts` and it works fine; the warning is non-blocking.\n    92→  - Server Actions (`\"use server\"` inside form actions) work well for OAuth sign-in/sign-out — no client-side JS needed for the OAuth redirect.\n    93→---\n    94→\n    95→## 2026-02-06 - US-004\n    96→- What was implemented: Redux Toolkit store setup with editionSlice (morning/evening type + date), uiSlice (theme, sidebar, share menu), typed hooks, and StoreProvider integrated into root layout\n    97→- Files changed:\n    98→  - `src/lib/store.ts` - Store factory with `makeStore()`, `AppStore`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch` types\n    99→  - `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Pre-typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`\n   100→  - `src/lib/features/edition-slice.ts` - Edition type (morning/evening) and date state management\n   101→  - `src/lib/features/ui-slice.ts` - Theme, sidebar open, share menu article ID state management\n   102→  - `src/components/store-provider.tsx` - Client component wrapping app with Redux Provider\n   103→  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `StoreProvider` wrapping `SessionProvider`\n   104→- **Learnings:**\n   105→  - React 19 / React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` ESLint rule forbids accessing `ref.current` during render, even for the RTK-recommended `useRef` store pattern. The `== null` guard is accepted for initialization, but any subsequent `ref.current` access in the render body is flagged. Workaround: use `useState(makeStore)` with lazy initializer instead of `useRef`.\n   106→  - RTK's `withTypes<>()` pattern (e.g., `useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()`) is the recommended way to create typed hooks in RTK v2.x — cleaner than the old `TypedUseSelectorHook` generic.\n   107→  - `StoreProvider` wraps `SessionProvider` in the layout tree so all auth-consuming components also have access to Redux state.\n   108→---\n   109→\n   110→## 2026-02-06 - US-005\n   111→- What was implemented: HackerNews data source integration with typed fetch function, Upstash Redis caching module, and shared Article type definition\n   112→- Files changed:\n   113→  - `src/types/article.ts` - Shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` type used by all data sources\n   114→  - `src/lib/cache.ts` - Generic `cacheGet<T>()` / `cacheSet()` wrappers around Upstash Redis with build-time safety (null stub when env vars missing)\n   115→  - `src/lib/sources/hackernews.ts` - `fetchHackerNewsArticles()` fetching top 5 front-page stories from HN Algolia API with 1-hour Redis cache and stale-cache fallback on API failure\n   116→- **Learnings:**\n   117→  - Upstash Redis JS SDK (`@upstash/redis`) uses `Redis.fromEnv()` which reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` automatically. Same env-var convention pattern as Auth.js v5.\n   118→  - Upstash SDK auto-serializes/deserializes JSON — no manual `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` needed. `redis.get<T>(key)` returns typed objects directly.\n   119→  - Like the Neon DB client, Redis client must handle missing env vars during `next build`. Solution: conditional initialization (`redis = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL ? Redis.fromEnv() : null`) with null-guard in cache functions.\n   120→  - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit. Some stories (Ask HN, Show HN text posts) have `url: null` — must fallback to `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=` permalink.\n   121→  - `Article` type is intentionally decoupled from Drizzle's `InferSelectModel` — the fetch layer produces plain objects that are later persisted by the edition builder (US-015).\n   122→---\n   123→\n   124→## 2026-02-06 - US-006\n   125→- What was implemented: GitHub trending repositories data source with typed fetch function, exponential backoff retry for rate limiting, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n   126→- Files changed:\n   127→  - `src/lib/sources/github.ts` - `fetchGitHubArticles()` fetching top 5 trending repos (created in last 7 days, sorted by stars) from GitHub Search API with retry on 403/429 and 1-hour Redis cache\n   128→- **Learnings:**\n   129→  - GitHub has no official \"trending\" API. The standard workaround is the search endpoint with `q=created:>{7-days-ago}&sort=stars&order=desc` — this is what most trending aggregators use.\n   130→  - GitHub's unauthenticated search API rate limit is 10 requests/minute (stricter than the 60 req/hour general API limit). The `Retry-After` header should be honored when present before falling back to exponential backoff.\n   131→  - `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` header is recommended by GitHub docs for forward compatibility with API versioning.\n   132→  - Repo owner's `avatar_url` makes a good `thumbnailUrl` — it's always present and CDN-served.\n   133→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback pattern as HackerNews module — keeps the architecture consistent across all data sources.\n   134→---\n   135→\n   136→## 2026-02-06 - US-007\n   137→- What was implemented: Reddit data source integration fetching top 5 hot posts from r/programming, r/webdev, r/javascript, r/typescript with NSFW/removed post filtering, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n   138→- Files changed:\n   139→  - `src/lib/sources/reddit.ts` - `fetchRedditArticles()` using Reddit JSON API with multi-subreddit `+` syntax, combined sorting by score, NSFW/removed filtering, and Article type mapping with metadata (subreddit, upvotes, comments, author)\n   140→- **Learnings:**\n   141→  - Reddit's public JSON API works by appending `.json` to any URL — no OAuth needed for read-only access. However, a descriptive `User-Agent` header is required or requests may get 429'd.\n   142→  - Multi-subreddit syntax (`r/A+B+C+D/hot.json`) fetches a merged listing in a single request — Reddit handles the cross-subreddit ranking server-side.\n   143→  - Reddit's `thumbnail` field uses string sentinels (`\"self\"`, `\"default\"`, `\"nsfw\"`, `\"spoiler\"`) instead of `null` when no image is available. Must check for `http://` or `https://` prefix to validate.\n   144→  - We fetch `limit=25` and filter/sort client-side to ensure we have 5 quality posts after removing NSFW, removed, and low-engagement items.\n   145→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as HackerNews and GitHub modules — architecture stays consistent.\n   146→---\n   147→\n   148→## 2026-02-06 - US-008\n   149→- What was implemented: Tech News RSS feed integration aggregating articles from The Verge, Ars Technica, and TechCrunch using `rss-parser`, with Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), graceful XML parsing error handling, and stale-cache fallback\n   150→- Files changed:\n   151→  - `src/lib/sources/rss.ts` - `fetchRssArticles()` fetching and aggregating top 5 articles (sorted by publish date) from 3 RSS feeds using `Promise.allSettled()` for independent failure handling, with cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n   152→  - `package.json` - Added `rss-parser` dependency (v3.13.0)\n   153→- **Learnings:**\n   154→  - `rss-parser` (v3.13.0) ships with built-in TypeScript types (`index.d.ts`). No `@types/rss-parser` needed. The `Parser.Item` type exposes `isoDate` (ISO 8601 string) which is more reliable for sorting than `pubDate` (RFC 2822 format varies across feeds).\n   155→  - `rss-parser`'s `parseURL()` uses Node's `http/https` modules internally with its own timeout handling. The `timeout` option in the constructor is in milliseconds and applies per-feed.\n   156→  - `Promise.allSettled()` is critical for multi-feed aggregation — one feed timing out (e.g., TechCrunch) shouldn't prevent The Verge and Ars Technica articles from being returned. Individual failures are logged as warnings.\n   157→  - RSS `<enclosure>` tag is the standard way feeds include images. Check `enclosure.type?.startsWith(\"image/\")` to filter for image enclosures vs. audio/video.\n   158→  - Context7 doesn't have `rss-parser` docs indexed — the npm package's `index.d.ts` is the best type reference.\n   159→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n   160→---\n   161→\n   162→## 2026-02-06 - US-009\n   163→- What was implemented: Hatena Bookmark data source integration fetching top 5 hot technology entries from Hatena Bookmark RSS feed, with bookmark count as engagement score, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n   164→- Files changed:\n   165→  - `src/lib/sources/hatena.ts` - `fetchHatenaArticles()` using `rss-parser` with custom field mapping for `hatena:bookmarkcount` and `hatena:imageurl`, sorted by bookmark count, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n   166→- **Learnings:**\n   167→  - Hatena Bookmark hot entries RSS is RDF 1.0 format at `https://b.hatena.ne.jp/hotentry/it.rss` (the \"it\" category = technology). Public, no auth needed, no rate limit documented.\n   168→  - `rss-parser`'s `customFields` option maps namespaced XML elements (e.g. `hatena:bookmarkcount`) to flat property names on item objects. Requires a generic type parameter on `Parser<Feed, Item>` to get TypeScript typing for the custom fields.\n   169→  - Hatena's `hatena:imageurl` provides a thumbnail for most entries — more reliable than trying to extract from `<enclosure>` (which Hatena's RDF feed doesn't include).\n   170→  - Entries are sorted by bookmark count (descending) rather than date — hot entries are already recent, and bookmark count is a better indicator of community interest.\n   171→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n   172→---\n   173→\n   174→## 2026-02-06 - US-010\n   175→- What was implemented: Bluesky data source integration fetching top 3 trending tech posts from Bluesky's public AT Protocol API using `searchPosts` with `sort=top`, mapped to Article type with engagement metadata, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n   176→- Files changed:\n   177→  - `src/lib/sources/bluesky.ts` - `fetchBlueskyArticles()` using `app.bsky.feed.searchPosts` public endpoint with tech-related query, `sort=top` for popular posts, AT URI→web URL conversion, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n   178→- **Learnings:**\n   179→  - Bluesky has no official \"trending posts\" API. The `app.bsky.unspecced.getTrends` and `getTrendingTopics` endpoints return topic names/metadata, not actual post content. Best approach for trending posts: `searchPosts` with `sort=top` and relevant keywords.\n   180→  - The public Bluesky AppView at `public.api.bsky.app` serves unauthenticated read-only requests. No API key or OAuth needed for `searchPosts`.\n   181→  - AT Protocol URIs follow `at://{did}/{collection}/{rkey}` format. To build a web-clickable URL: extract the rkey (last URI segment) and combine with author handle → `bsky.app/profile/{handle}/post/{rkey}`.\n   182→  - Bluesky posts have no separate `title` field — the post `text` (up to 300 chars) is the entire content. Truncating to ~100 chars for title and ~200 chars for excerpt provides a good card display.\n   183→  - `PostView` includes `likeCount`, `repostCount`, `replyCount` as optional integers (may be undefined if zero). Default to 0 with `?? 0`.\n   184→  - Author `avatar` URL from the API makes a serviceable `thumbnailUrl` since Bluesky posts often lack embedded images in the search response.\n   185→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n   186→---\n   187→\n   188→## 2026-02-06 - US-011\n   189→- What was implemented: YouTube trending data source integration fetching top 3 trending Science & Technology videos from YouTube Data API v3, with view count as engagement score, ISO 8601 duration parsing, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), quota-exceeded detection, and stale-cache fallback\n   190→- Files changed:\n   191→  - `src/lib/sources/youtube.ts` - `fetchYouTubeArticles()` using `videos.list` with `chart=mostPopular` and `videoCategoryId=28`, maps to Article type with metadata (channel, views, likes, comments, duration), cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n   192→- **Learnings:**\n   193→  - `videos.list` with `chart=mostPopular` costs only 1 quota unit per call, vs `search.list` at 100 units. Critical for staying within the 10,000 units/day limit — 1-hour cache means ~24 calls/day = 24 units total.\n   194→  - `videoCategoryId=28` is \"Science & Technology\" — YouTube category IDs are fixed numbers, not configurable strings. Full list available via `videoCategories.list` endpoint.\n   195→  - YouTube `contentDetails.duration` uses ISO 8601 format (`PT#H#M#S`). Regex parsing with optional groups handles all variants: `PT1H2M34S`, `PT12M5S`, `PT45S`.\n   196→  - `statistics` fields (`viewCount`, `likeCount`, `commentCount`) are returned as strings, not numbers. Must `Number()` convert them.\n   197→  - API key is passed as `key=` query parameter (not in headers). Missing `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` env var is handled gracefully — returns empty array without throwing, same as the Redis/DB build-time safety pattern.\n   198→  - Quota exceeded errors return HTTP 403 with `quotaExceeded` in the JSON body — detected by checking the response text before throwing.\n   199→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n   200→---\n   201→\n   202→## 2026-02-06 - US-012\n   203→- What was implemented: ProductHunt data source integration fetching today's top 5 product launches via ProductHunt API v2 (GraphQL), mapped to Article type with metadata (votes, tagline, topics), Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n   204→- Files changed:\n   205→  - `src/lib/sources/producthunt.ts` - `fetchProductHuntArticles()` using PH GraphQL API with `posts(first: 5, order: VOTES, postedAfter: today)` query, Bearer token auth, Relay-style edge/node response mapping, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n   206→- **Learnings:**\n   207→  - ProductHunt API v2 is GraphQL-only at `api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql`. No REST endpoint for fetching posts. Requires a Developer Token (Bearer auth), obtained from the PH developer dashboard.\n   208→  - The `posts` query supports `order: VOTES` and `postedAfter: DateTime!` to fetch today's top products. `postedAfter` expects an ISO 8601 timestamp (midnight UTC today) to scope results to today's launches.\n   209→  - PH uses Relay-style pagination: `posts.edges[].node` wraps each post. Topics are nested the same way: `topics.edges[].node.name`.\n   210→  - `thumbnail` is nullable (returns `{ url: string } | null`). Some new products haven't uploaded a thumbnail yet. Using optional chaining `node.thumbnail?.url ?? undefined`.\n   211→  - Env var `PRODUCTHUNT_API_TOKEN` follows the same conditional guard pattern as YouTube's `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` — returns empty array when missing, no build-time failures.\n   212→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n   213→---\n   214→\n   215→## 2026-02-06 - US-013\n   216→- What was implemented: Weather widget data source fetching current weather from OpenWeatherMap API with typed `WeatherData` interface, 30-minute Upstash Redis caching, city parameter (default: Tokyo), and graceful degradation when API key is missing\n   217→- Files changed:\n   218→  - `src/lib/sources/weather.ts` - `fetchWeather(city?)` returning `WeatherData | null` using OWM current-weather endpoint (`/data/2.5/weather`), cache-first + stale-fallback pattern with 30-minute TTL\n   219→- **Learnings:**\n   220→  - Weather module returns a dedicated `WeatherData` interface (not `Article[]`) because weather data powers a sidebar widget, not article cards. The `Article` type's fields (score, externalId, source) don't map semantically to weather data.\n   221→  - Return type is `WeatherData | null` (not `WeatherData[]`) since there's only one result. `null` lets the UI distinguish \"unavailable\" from \"loaded\" — unlike article sources where `[]` is a valid empty state.\n   222→  - OpenWeatherMap free-tier API key is passed via `appid=` query parameter. `units=metric` returns Celsius directly — no client-side conversion needed.\n   223→  - OWM's `weather` array may contain multiple conditions but [0] is the primary. Icon codes like `\"01d\"` / `\"10n\"` map to OWM's CDN: `openweathermap.org/img/wn/{icon}@2x.png`.\n   224→  - Cache TTL is 30 minutes (vs 1 hour for article sources) per PRD spec — weather changes more frequently than news rankings.\n   225→  - Same env-var guard pattern as YouTube/ProductHunt — returns `null` when `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` is unset, no build-time failures.\n   226→  - PRD also mentions caching in the `weather_cache` DB table. The current implementation caches in Redis only. DB caching will be integrated during the edition builder (US-015) when database writes are orchestrated.\n   227→---\n   228→\n   229→## 2026-02-06 - US-014\n   230→- What was implemented: Stock market widget data source fetching current index data for Nikkei 225, S&P 500, and NASDAQ from Yahoo Finance v7 quote API, with market-hours-aware Upstash Redis caching (15 min during trading hours, 6 hours after close), typed `StockData` interface, and stale-cache fallback\n   231→- Files changed:\n   232→  - `src/lib/sources/stocks.ts` - `fetchStockData()` returning `StockData[]` using Yahoo Finance batch quote endpoint with 3 symbols (`^N225`, `^GSPC`, `^IXIC`), market-hours-aware TTL selection, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n   233→- **Learnings:**\n   234→  - Yahoo Finance's public v7 quote endpoint (`query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote`) supports batch symbol queries via comma-separated `symbols` parameter — all 3 indices in a single request. No API key required.\n   235→  - Alpha Vantage free tier limits to 25 calls/day and 5/min — impractical for 3 indices with 15-minute refresh. Yahoo Finance has no documented rate limit for the quote endpoint.\n   236→  - Yahoo Finance returns `regularMarketPrice`, `regularMarketChange`, `regularMarketChangePercent` as numbers (not strings like YouTube's API). No type coercion needed.\n   237→  - Market-hours-aware TTL requires checking UTC time against two timezone windows: JPX trades 09:00–15:00 JST (00:00–06:00 UTC) and NYSE/NASDAQ trades 09:30–16:00 ET (13:30–21:00 UTC covering both EST and EDT). Using a broad window avoids DST detection complexity.\n   238→  - Index symbols use caret prefix: `^N225` (Nikkei), `^GSPC` (S&P 500), `^IXIC` (NASDAQ Composite). The `shortName` field provides a readable name as fallback.\n   239→  - Like weather, stock data returns a dedicated `StockData[]` interface (not `Article[]`) since it powers a sidebar widget, not article cards. Returns `[]` (not `null`) because multiple entries is a natural array state.\n   240→  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules. PRD also mentions `stock_cache` DB table — DB persistence will be integrated during US-015 edition builder.\n   241→---\n   242→\n   243→## 2026-02-06 - US-015\n   244→- What was implemented: Cron job for automated edition data collection. Creates `/api/cron/collect` GET route handler that fetches all 8 article sources + weather + stocks in parallel via `Promise.allSettled()`, normalizes scores to 0-100, creates a draft edition record, saves top-N articles per source to the database, caches widget data (weather/stocks), and marks the edition as published. Configured Vercel Cron in `vercel.json` for 06:00 and 17:00 Asia/Tokyo (21:00 UTC and 08:00 UTC).\n   245→- Files changed:\n   246→  - `src/app/api/cron/collect/route.ts` - Cron route handler with parallel fetching, score normalization, DB persistence, idempotency check, CRON_SECRET auth guard, and structured logging\n   247→  - `vercel.json` - Vercel Cron configuration with two schedules (morning/evening editions)\n   248→- **Learnings:**\n   249→  - Vercel Cron Jobs invoke endpoints via **GET** requests (not POST). Using `export async function POST()` would result in 405 when the cron fires.\n   250→  - Vercel automatically sends `CRON_SECRET` env var as `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header. Checking `authorization !== Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` is the standard auth guard pattern.\n   251→  - Vercel cron expressions use UTC only. Japan (Asia/Tokyo = UTC+9) doesn't observe DST, so the conversion is fixed: `06:00 JST` = `21:00 UTC` (cron: `0 21 * * *`), `17:00 JST` = `08:00 UTC` (cron: `0 8 * * *`).\n   252→  - `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: \"Asia/Tokyo\"` is the cleanest way to get current JST hour/date in a serverless environment without timezone libraries. Using `en-CA` locale for date formatting gives ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) directly.\n   253→  - Score normalization uses fixed ranges per source rather than percentile-ranking within each batch. This provides stable, predictable scoring even when batch sizes vary.\n   254→  - Idempotency guard (checking for existing edition with same type+date before insert) prevents duplicate editions on Vercel cron retries.\n   255→  - Weather and stock data are widgets, not articles - they're cached in Redis under `edition:widgets` key rather than inserted into the articles table.\n   256→---\n   257→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- **Tailwind v4 CSS-first config**: Design tokens are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using `@theme inline` and CSS custom properties with OKLCH color model. No `tailwind.config.ts` exists.\n- **shadcn/ui v3.8+**: Uses `components.json` at root, components go in `src/components/ui/`. CSS path is `src/app/globals.css`. Import utils from `@/lib/utils`.\n- **ESLint 9 flat config**: Configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` using `defineConfig()` from `eslint/config`. Includes `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`, `eslint-config-next/typescript`, and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n- **Dark-first theme**: `<html className=\"dark\">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Dark theme uses PRD palette (#0D0D0D bg, #FF6B35 accent). Light theme retains shadcn neutral defaults.\n- **PRD custom tokens**: Available as `ms-bg-primary`, `ms-bg-secondary`, `ms-bg-tertiary`, `ms-text-primary`, `ms-text-secondary`, `ms-text-muted`, `ms-accent`, `ms-border` in Tailwind classes.\n- **Fonts**: Inter (latin, `--font-inter`) + Noto Sans JP (japanese, `--font-noto-sans-jp`) via `next/font/google`. Font CSS var mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.\n- **Quality gates**: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` with `@neondatabase/serverless`. Config at `drizzle.config.ts`. Migrations output to `supabase/migrations/`.\n- **DB scripts**: `pnpm db:generate` (create migration SQL), `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:push` (dev push without migration files).\n- **Auth.js v5**: Config in `src/lib/auth.ts`, exports `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }`. Uses `@auth/drizzle-adapter` with custom table mappings. Route handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. Middleware at `src/middleware.ts` protects `/bookmarks` and `/settings`. `SessionProvider` in `src/components/session-provider.tsx` wraps root layout. Login page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`. Env vars: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`.\n- **DB connection fallback**: `src/lib/db/index.ts` uses placeholder URL when `DATABASE_URL` is unset to prevent build-time failures during static page generation.\n- **Redux Toolkit**: Store factory in `src/lib/store.ts` (`makeStore()`), typed hooks in `src/lib/hooks.ts` (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`). Slices in `src/lib/features/`. `StoreProvider` in `src/components/store-provider.tsx` wraps root layout (outside `SessionProvider`). Uses `useState(makeStore)` pattern instead of `useRef` to avoid React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` lint error.\n- **Upstash Redis cache**: `src/lib/cache.ts` exports `cacheGet<T>(key)` and `cacheSet(key, value, ttl)`. Conditional Redis init (null stub when env vars missing) for build-time safety. All source modules use cache key prefix `source:` (e.g. `source:hackernews`).\n- **Data source modules**: Each source in `src/lib/sources/{name}.ts` exports a single `fetch{Name}Articles(): Promise<Article[]>` function. Uses cache-first + stale-cache-fallback pattern. Returns `Article[]` from `@/types/article`.\n- **Article type**: `src/types/article.ts` defines shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` union type. Decoupled from Drizzle schema — fetch layer produces plain objects.\n- **Cron collection**: `src/app/api/cron/collect/route.ts` handles edition building. Vercel Cron (UTC) fires at `0 21 * * *` (06:00 JST morning) and `0 8 * * *` (17:00 JST evening). Auth via `CRON_SECRET` Bearer token. Idempotent — skips if edition already exists for that type+date. Scores normalized to 0–100 using fixed source ranges.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-001\n- What was implemented: Full project foundation with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Inter + Noto Sans JP fonts, ESLint 9 + Prettier, and PRD design tokens\n- Files changed:\n  - `package.json` - Project config with all dependencies\n  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config with `@/*` path alias\n  - `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint 9 flat config with Prettier\n  - `.prettierrc` - Prettier config with Tailwind plugin\n  - `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS with @tailwindcss/postcss\n  - `next.config.ts` - Next.js config\n  - `components.json` - shadcn/ui config\n  - `src/app/globals.css` - Tailwind v4 design tokens with PRD palette (OKLCH)\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with fonts and dark class\n  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Placeholder home page\n  - `src/lib/utils.ts` - shadcn cn() utility\n  - `.gitignore` - Added CLAUDE.md\n  - Created dirs: `src/components/ui/`, `src/types/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `tests/`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `create-next-app@latest` (Feb 2026) generates Next.js 16.1.6, not 15. PRD says \"15\" but latest is 16. Used latest.\n  - shadcn init with `--base-color neutral` moves `src/app/` to `app/` at root. Must move back to `src/app/` after init.\n  - `components.json` CSS path must be updated to `src/app/globals.css` after moving app dir back.\n  - Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color model for CSS variables. PRD hex values converted: `#0D0D0D` → `oklch(0.159 0 0)`, `#FF6B35` → `oklch(0.705 0.193 39.231)`.\n  - `--style` flag removed from shadcn CLI in v3.8+; new-york is the default.\n  - ESLint 9 uses `defineConfig()` and `globalIgnores()` from `eslint/config`.\n  - `--no-react-compiler` flag needed for non-interactive create-next-app.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-002\n- What was implemented: Complete Drizzle ORM schema with 7 tables (users, editions, articles, bookmarks, hidden_items, weather_cache, stock_cache), 5 PostgreSQL enums, typed relations, Neon HTTP database connection, and migration generation\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - All table definitions, enums, and relations with JSDoc\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Drizzle instance with Neon HTTP driver and schema binding\n  - `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit config pointing to schema and supabase/migrations output\n  - `package.json` - Added `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push` scripts; added `drizzle-kit` devDep\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_nifty_blob.sql` - Generated initial migration with all tables, enums, FKs, and unique index\n  - `supabase/migrations/meta/` - Drizzle Kit snapshot and journal metadata\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Drizzle v0.45+ uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` adapter with `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` for HTTP-mode connections (one HTTP request per query, no persistent connection pool — ideal for Vercel serverless).\n  - `pgEnum` values must be defined before table references. Drizzle handles ordering in generated SQL.\n  - `uuid().defaultRandom()` maps to `gen_random_uuid()` in PostgreSQL — built-in, no extension needed.\n  - `date()` with `{ mode: \"string\" }` stores as PostgreSQL `date` type but returns `string` in TypeScript (e.g., \"2026-02-06\"), avoiding timezone issues.\n  - Bookmarks unique constraint uses `uniqueIndex()` in the third-arg callback of `pgTable` — Drizzle v0.45 uses array syntax `(table) => [...]`.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` creates migration SQL + snapshot JSON. The `out` config must match where migrations are stored.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-003\n- What was implemented: Full Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) integration with Google and GitHub OAuth providers, Drizzle adapter for database session persistence, login page, auth middleware, SessionProvider wrapper, and header with auth state display\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth.js v5 config with Google/GitHub providers, Drizzle adapter with custom table mappings, `/login` as custom signIn page\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` tables for Auth.js; changed `users.id` from `uuid` to `text` for Auth.js compatibility; renamed `avatarUrl` → `image`, added `emailVerified`; updated `bookmarks.userId` and `hiddenItems.userId` from `uuid` to `text`; added `accountsRelations` and `sessionsRelations`\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Added placeholder DATABASE_URL fallback for build-time safety\n  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth.js catch-all route handler\n  - `src/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware protecting `/bookmarks` and `/settings`, redirects to `/login` with `callbackUrl`\n  - `src/components/session-provider.tsx` - Client-side SessionProvider wrapper\n  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with GitHub and Google OAuth buttons, styled with PRD tokens\n  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Server Component header with user avatar/name when logged in, Login button when not, sign-out action\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `SessionProvider` wrapper and `Header` component\n  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - shadcn/ui button component (added via CLI)\n  - `package.json` - Added `@auth/core` and `@auth/drizzle-adapter` dependencies\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_cold_morbius.sql` - Regenerated migration with all Auth.js tables\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Auth.js v5 Drizzle adapter requires `text` PKs on the `users` table (not `uuid`). It also expects `image` (not `avatarUrl`) and `emailVerified` columns. Custom table mappings via `usersTable`, `accountsTable`, `sessionsTable`, `verificationTokensTable` options.\n  - Auth.js v5 auto-detects env vars by convention: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for GitHub, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`/`AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` for Google. No need to pass `clientId`/`clientSecret` manually.\n  - `NextAuth()` is called at module top level, which eagerly initializes the Drizzle adapter. If `DATABASE_URL` is missing at build time, `neon()` throws. Solution: provide a placeholder URL fallback in `db/index.ts` — it's never actually queried during build, only satisfies the constructor.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` is interactive when detecting column renames (e.g., `avatar_url` → `image`). Cleanest workaround: delete old migrations and regenerate from scratch if schema shape changes significantly.\n  - Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for `middleware.ts` — it recommends `proxy` convention instead. However, Auth.js v5 still uses `middleware.ts` and it works fine; the warning is non-blocking.\n  - Server Actions (`\"use server\"` inside form actions) work well for OAuth sign-in/sign-out — no client-side JS needed for the OAuth redirect.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-004\n- What was implemented: Redux Toolkit store setup with editionSlice (morning/evening type + date), uiSlice (theme, sidebar, share menu), typed hooks, and StoreProvider integrated into root layout\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/store.ts` - Store factory with `makeStore()`, `AppStore`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch` types\n  - `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Pre-typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`\n  - `src/lib/features/edition-slice.ts` - Edition type (morning/evening) and date state management\n  - `src/lib/features/ui-slice.ts` - Theme, sidebar open, share menu article ID state management\n  - `src/components/store-provider.tsx` - Client component wrapping app with Redux Provider\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `StoreProvider` wrapping `SessionProvider`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - React 19 / React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` ESLint rule forbids accessing `ref.current` during render, even for the RTK-recommended `useRef` store pattern. The `== null` guard is accepted for initialization, but any subsequent `ref.current` access in the render body is flagged. Workaround: use `useState(makeStore)` with lazy initializer instead of `useRef`.\n  - RTK's `withTypes<>()` pattern (e.g., `useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()`) is the recommended way to create typed hooks in RTK v2.x — cleaner than the old `TypedUseSelectorHook` generic.\n  - `StoreProvider` wraps `SessionProvider` in the layout tree so all auth-consuming components also have access to Redux state.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-005\n- What was implemented: HackerNews data source integration with typed fetch function, Upstash Redis caching module, and shared Article type definition\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/types/article.ts` - Shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` type used by all data sources\n  - `src/lib/cache.ts` - Generic `cacheGet<T>()` / `cacheSet()` wrappers around Upstash Redis with build-time safety (null stub when env vars missing)\n  - `src/lib/sources/hackernews.ts` - `fetchHackerNewsArticles()` fetching top 5 front-page stories from HN Algolia API with 1-hour Redis cache and stale-cache fallback on API failure\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Upstash Redis JS SDK (`@upstash/redis`) uses `Redis.fromEnv()` which reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` automatically. Same env-var convention pattern as Auth.js v5.\n  - Upstash SDK auto-serializes/deserializes JSON — no manual `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` needed. `redis.get<T>(key)` returns typed objects directly.\n  - Like the Neon DB client, Redis client must handle missing env vars during `next build`. Solution: conditional initialization (`redis = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL ? Redis.fromEnv() : null`) with null-guard in cache functions.\n  - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit. Some stories (Ask HN, Show HN text posts) have `url: null` — must fallback to `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=` permalink.\n  - `Article` type is intentionally decoupled from Drizzle's `InferSelectModel` — the fetch layer produces plain objects that are later persisted by the edition builder (US-015).\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-006\n- What was implemented: GitHub trending repositories data source with typed fetch function, exponential backoff retry for rate limiting, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/github.ts` - `fetchGitHubArticles()` fetching top 5 trending repos (created in last 7 days, sorted by stars) from GitHub Search API with retry on 403/429 and 1-hour Redis cache\n- **Learnings:**\n  - GitHub has no official \"trending\" API. The standard workaround is the search endpoint with `q=created:>{7-days-ago}&sort=stars&order=desc` — this is what most trending aggregators use.\n  - GitHub's unauthenticated search API rate limit is 10 requests/minute (stricter than the 60 req/hour general API limit). The `Retry-After` header should be honored when present before falling back to exponential backoff.\n  - `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` header is recommended by GitHub docs for forward compatibility with API versioning.\n  - Repo owner's `avatar_url` makes a good `thumbnailUrl` — it's always present and CDN-served.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback pattern as HackerNews module — keeps the architecture consistent across all data sources.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-007\n- What was implemented: Reddit data source integration fetching top 5 hot posts from r/programming, r/webdev, r/javascript, r/typescript with NSFW/removed post filtering, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/reddit.ts` - `fetchRedditArticles()` using Reddit JSON API with multi-subreddit `+` syntax, combined sorting by score, NSFW/removed filtering, and Article type mapping with metadata (subreddit, upvotes, comments, author)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Reddit's public JSON API works by appending `.json` to any URL — no OAuth needed for read-only access. However, a descriptive `User-Agent` header is required or requests may get 429'd.\n  - Multi-subreddit syntax (`r/A+B+C+D/hot.json`) fetches a merged listing in a single request — Reddit handles the cross-subreddit ranking server-side.\n  - Reddit's `thumbnail` field uses string sentinels (`\"self\"`, `\"default\"`, `\"nsfw\"`, `\"spoiler\"`) instead of `null` when no image is available. Must check for `http://` or `https://` prefix to validate.\n  - We fetch `limit=25` and filter/sort client-side to ensure we have 5 quality posts after removing NSFW, removed, and low-engagement items.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as HackerNews and GitHub modules — architecture stays consistent.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-008\n- What was implemented: Tech News RSS feed integration aggregating articles from The Verge, Ars Technica, and TechCrunch using `rss-parser`, with Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), graceful XML parsing error handling, and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/rss.ts` - `fetchRssArticles()` fetching and aggregating top 5 articles (sorted by publish date) from 3 RSS feeds using `Promise.allSettled()` for independent failure handling, with cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n  - `package.json` - Added `rss-parser` dependency (v3.13.0)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `rss-parser` (v3.13.0) ships with built-in TypeScript types (`index.d.ts`). No `@types/rss-parser` needed. The `Parser.Item` type exposes `isoDate` (ISO 8601 string) which is more reliable for sorting than `pubDate` (RFC 2822 format varies across feeds).\n  - `rss-parser`'s `parseURL()` uses Node's `http/https` modules internally with its own timeout handling. The `timeout` option in the constructor is in milliseconds and applies per-feed.\n  - `Promise.allSettled()` is critical for multi-feed aggregation — one feed timing out (e.g., TechCrunch) shouldn't prevent The Verge and Ars Technica articles from being returned. Individual failures are logged as warnings.\n  - RSS `<enclosure>` tag is the standard way feeds include images. Check `enclosure.type?.startsWith(\"image/\")` to filter for image enclosures vs. audio/video.\n  - Context7 doesn't have `rss-parser` docs indexed — the npm package's `index.d.ts` is the best type reference.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-009\n- What was implemented: Hatena Bookmark data source integration fetching top 5 hot technology entries from Hatena Bookmark RSS feed, with bookmark count as engagement score, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/hatena.ts` - `fetchHatenaArticles()` using `rss-parser` with custom field mapping for `hatena:bookmarkcount` and `hatena:imageurl`, sorted by bookmark count, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Hatena Bookmark hot entries RSS is RDF 1.0 format at `https://b.hatena.ne.jp/hotentry/it.rss` (the \"it\" category = technology). Public, no auth needed, no rate limit documented.\n  - `rss-parser`'s `customFields` option maps namespaced XML elements (e.g. `hatena:bookmarkcount`) to flat property names on item objects. Requires a generic type parameter on `Parser<Feed, Item>` to get TypeScript typing for the custom fields.\n  - Hatena's `hatena:imageurl` provides a thumbnail for most entries — more reliable than trying to extract from `<enclosure>` (which Hatena's RDF feed doesn't include).\n  - Entries are sorted by bookmark count (descending) rather than date — hot entries are already recent, and bookmark count is a better indicator of community interest.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-010\n- What was implemented: Bluesky data source integration fetching top 3 trending tech posts from Bluesky's public AT Protocol API using `searchPosts` with `sort=top`, mapped to Article type with engagement metadata, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/bluesky.ts` - `fetchBlueskyArticles()` using `app.bsky.feed.searchPosts` public endpoint with tech-related query, `sort=top` for popular posts, AT URI→web URL conversion, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Bluesky has no official \"trending posts\" API. The `app.bsky.unspecced.getTrends` and `getTrendingTopics` endpoints return topic names/metadata, not actual post content. Best approach for trending posts: `searchPosts` with `sort=top` and relevant keywords.\n  - The public Bluesky AppView at `public.api.bsky.app` serves unauthenticated read-only requests. No API key or OAuth needed for `searchPosts`.\n  - AT Protocol URIs follow `at://{did}/{collection}/{rkey}` format. To build a web-clickable URL: extract the rkey (last URI segment) and combine with author handle → `bsky.app/profile/{handle}/post/{rkey}`.\n  - Bluesky posts have no separate `title` field — the post `text` (up to 300 chars) is the entire content. Truncating to ~100 chars for title and ~200 chars for excerpt provides a good card display.\n  - `PostView` includes `likeCount`, `repostCount`, `replyCount` as optional integers (may be undefined if zero). Default to 0 with `?? 0`.\n  - Author `avatar` URL from the API makes a serviceable `thumbnailUrl` since Bluesky posts often lack embedded images in the search response.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-011\n- What was implemented: YouTube trending data source integration fetching top 3 trending Science & Technology videos from YouTube Data API v3, with view count as engagement score, ISO 8601 duration parsing, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), quota-exceeded detection, and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/youtube.ts` - `fetchYouTubeArticles()` using `videos.list` with `chart=mostPopular` and `videoCategoryId=28`, maps to Article type with metadata (channel, views, likes, comments, duration), cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `videos.list` with `chart=mostPopular` costs only 1 quota unit per call, vs `search.list` at 100 units. Critical for staying within the 10,000 units/day limit — 1-hour cache means ~24 calls/day = 24 units total.\n  - `videoCategoryId=28` is \"Science & Technology\" — YouTube category IDs are fixed numbers, not configurable strings. Full list available via `videoCategories.list` endpoint.\n  - YouTube `contentDetails.duration` uses ISO 8601 format (`PT#H#M#S`). Regex parsing with optional groups handles all variants: `PT1H2M34S`, `PT12M5S`, `PT45S`.\n  - `statistics` fields (`viewCount`, `likeCount`, `commentCount`) are returned as strings, not numbers. Must `Number()` convert them.\n  - API key is passed as `key=` query parameter (not in headers). Missing `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` env var is handled gracefully — returns empty array without throwing, same as the Redis/DB build-time safety pattern.\n  - Quota exceeded errors return HTTP 403 with `quotaExceeded` in the JSON body — detected by checking the response text before throwing.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-012\n- What was implemented: ProductHunt data source integration fetching today's top 5 product launches via ProductHunt API v2 (GraphQL), mapped to Article type with metadata (votes, tagline, topics), Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/producthunt.ts` - `fetchProductHuntArticles()` using PH GraphQL API with `posts(first: 5, order: VOTES, postedAfter: today)` query, Bearer token auth, Relay-style edge/node response mapping, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - ProductHunt API v2 is GraphQL-only at `api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql`. No REST endpoint for fetching posts. Requires a Developer Token (Bearer auth), obtained from the PH developer dashboard.\n  - The `posts` query supports `order: VOTES` and `postedAfter: DateTime!` to fetch today's top products. `postedAfter` expects an ISO 8601 timestamp (midnight UTC today) to scope results to today's launches.\n  - PH uses Relay-style pagination: `posts.edges[].node` wraps each post. Topics are nested the same way: `topics.edges[].node.name`.\n  - `thumbnail` is nullable (returns `{ url: string } | null`). Some new products haven't uploaded a thumbnail yet. Using optional chaining `node.thumbnail?.url ?? undefined`.\n  - Env var `PRODUCTHUNT_API_TOKEN` follows the same conditional guard pattern as YouTube's `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` — returns empty array when missing, no build-time failures.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-013\n- What was implemented: Weather widget data source fetching current weather from OpenWeatherMap API with typed `WeatherData` interface, 30-minute Upstash Redis caching, city parameter (default: Tokyo), and graceful degradation when API key is missing\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/weather.ts` - `fetchWeather(city?)` returning `WeatherData | null` using OWM current-weather endpoint (`/data/2.5/weather`), cache-first + stale-fallback pattern with 30-minute TTL\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Weather module returns a dedicated `WeatherData` interface (not `Article[]`) because weather data powers a sidebar widget, not article cards. The `Article` type's fields (score, externalId, source) don't map semantically to weather data.\n  - Return type is `WeatherData | null` (not `WeatherData[]`) since there's only one result. `null` lets the UI distinguish \"unavailable\" from \"loaded\" — unlike article sources where `[]` is a valid empty state.\n  - OpenWeatherMap free-tier API key is passed via `appid=` query parameter. `units=metric` returns Celsius directly — no client-side conversion needed.\n  - OWM's `weather` array may contain multiple conditions but [0] is the primary. Icon codes like `\"01d\"` / `\"10n\"` map to OWM's CDN: `openweathermap.org/img/wn/{icon}@2x.png`.\n  - Cache TTL is 30 minutes (vs 1 hour for article sources) per PRD spec — weather changes more frequently than news rankings.\n  - Same env-var guard pattern as YouTube/ProductHunt — returns `null` when `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` is unset, no build-time failures.\n  - PRD also mentions caching in the `weather_cache` DB table. The current implementation caches in Redis only. DB caching will be integrated during the edition builder (US-015) when database writes are orchestrated.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-014\n- What was implemented: Stock market widget data source fetching current index data for Nikkei 225, S&P 500, and NASDAQ from Yahoo Finance v7 quote API, with market-hours-aware Upstash Redis caching (15 min during trading hours, 6 hours after close), typed `StockData` interface, and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/stocks.ts` - `fetchStockData()` returning `StockData[]` using Yahoo Finance batch quote endpoint with 3 symbols (`^N225`, `^GSPC`, `^IXIC`), market-hours-aware TTL selection, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Yahoo Finance's public v7 quote endpoint (`query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote`) supports batch symbol queries via comma-separated `symbols` parameter — all 3 indices in a single request. No API key required.\n  - Alpha Vantage free tier limits to 25 calls/day and 5/min — impractical for 3 indices with 15-minute refresh. Yahoo Finance has no documented rate limit for the quote endpoint.\n  - Yahoo Finance returns `regularMarketPrice`, `regularMarketChange`, `regularMarketChangePercent` as numbers (not strings like YouTube's API). No type coercion needed.\n  - Market-hours-aware TTL requires checking UTC time against two timezone windows: JPX trades 09:00–15:00 JST (00:00–06:00 UTC) and NYSE/NASDAQ trades 09:30–16:00 ET (13:30–21:00 UTC covering both EST and EDT). Using a broad window avoids DST detection complexity.\n  - Index symbols use caret prefix: `^N225` (Nikkei), `^GSPC` (S&P 500), `^IXIC` (NASDAQ Composite). The `shortName` field provides a readable name as fallback.\n  - Like weather, stock data returns a dedicated `StockData[]` interface (not `Article[]`) since it powers a sidebar widget, not article cards. Returns `[]` (not `null`) because multiple entries is a natural array state.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules. PRD also mentions `stock_cache` DB table — DB persistence will be integrated during US-015 edition builder.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-015\n- What was implemented: Cron job for automated edition data collection. Creates `/api/cron/collect` GET route handler that fetches all 8 article sources + weather + stocks in parallel via `Promise.allSettled()`, normalizes scores to 0-100, creates a draft edition record, saves top-N articles per source to the database, caches widget data (weather/stocks), and marks the edition as published. Configured Vercel Cron in `vercel.json` for 06:00 and 17:00 Asia/Tokyo (21:00 UTC and 08:00 UTC).\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/app/api/cron/collect/route.ts` - Cron route handler with parallel fetching, score normalization, DB persistence, idempotency check, CRON_SECRET auth guard, and structured logging\n  - `vercel.json` - Vercel Cron configuration with two schedules (morning/evening editions)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Vercel Cron Jobs invoke endpoints via **GET** requests (not POST). Using `export async function POST()` would result in 405 when the cron fires.\n  - Vercel automatically sends `CRON_SECRET` env var as `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header. Checking `authorization !== Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` is the standard auth guard pattern.\n  - Vercel cron expressions use UTC only. Japan (Asia/Tokyo = UTC+9) doesn't observe DST, so the conversion is fixed: `06:00 JST` = `21:00 UTC` (cron: `0 21 * * *`), `17:00 JST` = `08:00 UTC` (cron: `0 8 * * *`).\n  - `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: \"Asia/Tokyo\"` is the cleanest way to get current JST hour/date in a serverless environment without timezone libraries. Using `en-CA` locale for date formatting gives ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) directly.\n  - Score normalization uses fixed ranges per source rather than percentile-ranking within each batch. This provides stable, predictable scoring even when batch sizes vary.\n  - Idempotency guard (checking for existing edition with same type+date before insert) prevents duplicate editions on Vercel cron retries.\n  - Weather and stock data are widgets, not articles - they're cached in Redis under `edition:widgets` key rather than inserted into the articles table.\n---\n","numLines":257,"startLine":1,"totalLines":257}}}

When thumbnails fail (404, CORS), the card degrades to showing the first letter of the source label — no broken image icons.\n3. **Source brand color map** — `SOURCE_COLORS` and `SOURCE_LABELS` are typed as `Record<ArticleSource, string>`, which ensures compile-time safety — if a new source is added to the `ArticleSource` union, TypeScript will flag any missing entries.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nNow let me run the quality gates."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2721,"cache_read_input_tokens":64964,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2721},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"88815456-b046-4c31-96ee-ef63e843cf94","uuid":"527c79d0-74e9-45f0-9aa4-9034e118e879"}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- **Tailwind v4 CSS-first config**: Design tokens are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using `@theme inline` and CSS custom properties with OKLCH color model. No `tailwind.config.ts` exists.\n- **shadcn/ui v3.8+**: Uses `components.json` at root, components go in `src/components/ui/`. CSS path is `src/app/globals.css`. Import utils from `@/lib/utils`.\n- **ESLint 9 flat config**: Configuration in `eslint.config.mjs` using `defineConfig()` from `eslint/config`. Includes `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`, `eslint-config-next/typescript`, and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n- **Dark-first theme**: `<html className=\"dark\">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Dark theme uses PRD palette (#0D0D0D bg, #FF6B35 accent). Light theme retains shadcn neutral defaults.\n- **PRD custom tokens**: Available as `ms-bg-primary`, `ms-bg-secondary`, `ms-bg-tertiary`, `ms-text-primary`, `ms-text-secondary`, `ms-text-muted`, `ms-accent`, `ms-border` in Tailwind classes.\n- **Fonts**: Inter (latin, `--font-inter`) + Noto Sans JP (japanese, `--font-noto-sans-jp`) via `next/font/google`. Font CSS var mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.\n- **Quality gates**: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, connection in `src/lib/db/index.ts`. Uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` with `@neondatabase/serverless`. Config at `drizzle.config.ts`. Migrations output to `supabase/migrations/`.\n- **DB scripts**: `pnpm db:generate` (create migration SQL), `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:push` (dev push without migration files).\n- **Auth.js v5**: Config in `src/lib/auth.ts`, exports `{ handlers, auth, signIn, signOut }`. Uses `@auth/drizzle-adapter` with custom table mappings. Route handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. Middleware at `src/middleware.ts` protects `/bookmarks` and `/settings`. `SessionProvider` in `src/components/session-provider.tsx` wraps root layout. Login page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`. Env vars: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`.\n- **DB connection fallback**: `src/lib/db/index.ts` uses placeholder URL when `DATABASE_URL` is unset to prevent build-time failures during static page generation.\n- **Redux Toolkit**: Store factory in `src/lib/store.ts` (`makeStore()`), typed hooks in `src/lib/hooks.ts` (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`). Slices in `src/lib/features/`. `StoreProvider` in `src/components/store-provider.tsx` wraps root layout (outside `SessionProvider`). Uses `useState(makeStore)` pattern instead of `useRef` to avoid React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` lint error.\n- **Upstash Redis cache**: `src/lib/cache.ts` exports `cacheGet<T>(key)` and `cacheSet(key, value, ttl)`. Conditional Redis init (null stub when env vars missing) for build-time safety. All source modules use cache key prefix `source:` (e.g. `source:hackernews`).\n- **Data source modules**: Each source in `src/lib/sources/{name}.ts` exports a single `fetch{Name}Articles(): Promise<Article[]>` function. Uses cache-first + stale-cache-fallback pattern. Returns `Article[]` from `@/types/article`.\n- **Article type**: `src/types/article.ts` defines shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` union type. Decoupled from Drizzle schema — fetch layer produces plain objects.\n- **Cron collection**: `src/app/api/cron/collect/route.ts` handles edition building. Vercel Cron (UTC) fires at `0 21 * * *` (06:00 JST morning) and `0 8 * * *` (17:00 JST evening). Auth via `CRON_SECRET` Bearer token. Idempotent — skips if edition already exists for that type+date. Scores normalized to 0–100 using fixed source ranges.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-001\n- What was implemented: Full project foundation with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Inter + Noto Sans JP fonts, ESLint 9 + Prettier, and PRD design tokens\n- Files changed:\n  - `package.json` - Project config with all dependencies\n  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config with `@/*` path alias\n  - `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint 9 flat config with Prettier\n  - `.prettierrc` - Prettier config with Tailwind plugin\n  - `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS with @tailwindcss/postcss\n  - `next.config.ts` - Next.js config\n  - `components.json` - shadcn/ui config\n  - `src/app/globals.css` - Tailwind v4 design tokens with PRD palette (OKLCH)\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with fonts and dark class\n  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Placeholder home page\n  - `src/lib/utils.ts` - shadcn cn() utility\n  - `.gitignore` - Added CLAUDE.md\n  - Created dirs: `src/components/ui/`, `src/types/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `tests/`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `create-next-app@latest` (Feb 2026) generates Next.js 16.1.6, not 15. PRD says \"15\" but latest is 16. Used latest.\n  - shadcn init with `--base-color neutral` moves `src/app/` to `app/` at root. Must move back to `src/app/` after init.\n  - `components.json` CSS path must be updated to `src/app/globals.css` after moving app dir back.\n  - Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color model for CSS variables. PRD hex values converted: `#0D0D0D` → `oklch(0.159 0 0)`, `#FF6B35` → `oklch(0.705 0.193 39.231)`.\n  - `--style` flag removed from shadcn CLI in v3.8+; new-york is the default.\n  - ESLint 9 uses `defineConfig()` and `globalIgnores()` from `eslint/config`.\n  - `--no-react-compiler` flag needed for non-interactive create-next-app.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-002\n- What was implemented: Complete Drizzle ORM schema with 7 tables (users, editions, articles, bookmarks, hidden_items, weather_cache, stock_cache), 5 PostgreSQL enums, typed relations, Neon HTTP database connection, and migration generation\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - All table definitions, enums, and relations with JSDoc\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Drizzle instance with Neon HTTP driver and schema binding\n  - `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit config pointing to schema and supabase/migrations output\n  - `package.json` - Added `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push` scripts; added `drizzle-kit` devDep\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_nifty_blob.sql` - Generated initial migration with all tables, enums, FKs, and unique index\n  - `supabase/migrations/meta/` - Drizzle Kit snapshot and journal metadata\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Drizzle v0.45+ uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` adapter with `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` for HTTP-mode connections (one HTTP request per query, no persistent connection pool — ideal for Vercel serverless).\n  - `pgEnum` values must be defined before table references. Drizzle handles ordering in generated SQL.\n  - `uuid().defaultRandom()` maps to `gen_random_uuid()` in PostgreSQL — built-in, no extension needed.\n  - `date()` with `{ mode: \"string\" }` stores as PostgreSQL `date` type but returns `string` in TypeScript (e.g., \"2026-02-06\"), avoiding timezone issues.\n  - Bookmarks unique constraint uses `uniqueIndex()` in the third-arg callback of `pgTable` — Drizzle v0.45 uses array syntax `(table) => [...]`.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` creates migration SQL + snapshot JSON. The `out` config must match where migrations are stored.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-003\n- What was implemented: Full Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) integration with Google and GitHub OAuth providers, Drizzle adapter for database session persistence, login page, auth middleware, SessionProvider wrapper, and header with auth state display\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth.js v5 config with Google/GitHub providers, Drizzle adapter with custom table mappings, `/login` as custom signIn page\n  - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `accounts`, `sessions`, `verificationTokens` tables for Auth.js; changed `users.id` from `uuid` to `text` for Auth.js compatibility; renamed `avatarUrl` → `image`, added `emailVerified`; updated `bookmarks.userId` and `hiddenItems.userId` from `uuid` to `text`; added `accountsRelations` and `sessionsRelations`\n  - `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Added placeholder DATABASE_URL fallback for build-time safety\n  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth.js catch-all route handler\n  - `src/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware protecting `/bookmarks` and `/settings`, redirects to `/login` with `callbackUrl`\n  - `src/components/session-provider.tsx` - Client-side SessionProvider wrapper\n  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page with GitHub and Google OAuth buttons, styled with PRD tokens\n  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Server Component header with user avatar/name when logged in, Login button when not, sign-out action\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `SessionProvider` wrapper and `Header` component\n  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - shadcn/ui button component (added via CLI)\n  - `package.json` - Added `@auth/core` and `@auth/drizzle-adapter` dependencies\n  - `supabase/migrations/0000_cold_morbius.sql` - Regenerated migration with all Auth.js tables\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Auth.js v5 Drizzle adapter requires `text` PKs on the `users` table (not `uuid`). It also expects `image` (not `avatarUrl`) and `emailVerified` columns. Custom table mappings via `usersTable`, `accountsTable`, `sessionsTable`, `verificationTokensTable` options.\n  - Auth.js v5 auto-detects env vars by convention: `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`/`AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` for GitHub, `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`/`AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` for Google. No need to pass `clientId`/`clientSecret` manually.\n  - `NextAuth()` is called at module top level, which eagerly initializes the Drizzle adapter. If `DATABASE_URL` is missing at build time, `neon()` throws. Solution: provide a placeholder URL fallback in `db/index.ts` — it's never actually queried during build, only satisfies the constructor.\n  - `drizzle-kit generate` is interactive when detecting column renames (e.g., `avatar_url` → `image`). Cleanest workaround: delete old migrations and regenerate from scratch if schema shape changes significantly.\n  - Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for `middleware.ts` — it recommends `proxy` convention instead. However, Auth.js v5 still uses `middleware.ts` and it works fine; the warning is non-blocking.\n  - Server Actions (`\"use server\"` inside form actions) work well for OAuth sign-in/sign-out — no client-side JS needed for the OAuth redirect.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-004\n- What was implemented: Redux Toolkit store setup with editionSlice (morning/evening type + date), uiSlice (theme, sidebar, share menu), typed hooks, and StoreProvider integrated into root layout\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/store.ts` - Store factory with `makeStore()`, `AppStore`, `RootState`, `AppDispatch` types\n  - `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Pre-typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`, `useAppStore`\n  - `src/lib/features/edition-slice.ts` - Edition type (morning/evening) and date state management\n  - `src/lib/features/ui-slice.ts` - Theme, sidebar open, share menu article ID state management\n  - `src/components/store-provider.tsx` - Client component wrapping app with Redux Provider\n  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `StoreProvider` wrapping `SessionProvider`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - React 19 / React Compiler's `react-hooks/refs` ESLint rule forbids accessing `ref.current` during render, even for the RTK-recommended `useRef` store pattern. The `== null` guard is accepted for initialization, but any subsequent `ref.current` access in the render body is flagged. Workaround: use `useState(makeStore)` with lazy initializer instead of `useRef`.\n  - RTK's `withTypes<>()` pattern (e.g., `useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()`) is the recommended way to create typed hooks in RTK v2.x — cleaner than the old `TypedUseSelectorHook` generic.\n  - `StoreProvider` wraps `SessionProvider` in the layout tree so all auth-consuming components also have access to Redux state.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-005\n- What was implemented: HackerNews data source integration with typed fetch function, Upstash Redis caching module, and shared Article type definition\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/types/article.ts` - Shared `Article` interface and `ArticleSource` type used by all data sources\n  - `src/lib/cache.ts` - Generic `cacheGet<T>()` / `cacheSet()` wrappers around Upstash Redis with build-time safety (null stub when env vars missing)\n  - `src/lib/sources/hackernews.ts` - `fetchHackerNewsArticles()` fetching top 5 front-page stories from HN Algolia API with 1-hour Redis cache and stale-cache fallback on API failure\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Upstash Redis JS SDK (`@upstash/redis`) uses `Redis.fromEnv()` which reads `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` automatically. Same env-var convention pattern as Auth.js v5.\n  - Upstash SDK auto-serializes/deserializes JSON — no manual `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` needed. `redis.get<T>(key)` returns typed objects directly.\n  - Like the Neon DB client, Redis client must handle missing env vars during `next build`. Solution: conditional initialization (`redis = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL ? Redis.fromEnv() : null`) with null-guard in cache functions.\n  - HN Algolia API (`hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page&hitsPerPage=5`) is public with no rate limit. Some stories (Ask HN, Show HN text posts) have `url: null` — must fallback to `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=` permalink.\n  - `Article` type is intentionally decoupled from Drizzle's `InferSelectModel` — the fetch layer produces plain objects that are later persisted by the edition builder (US-015).\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-006\n- What was implemented: GitHub trending repositories data source with typed fetch function, exponential backoff retry for rate limiting, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/github.ts` - `fetchGitHubArticles()` fetching top 5 trending repos (created in last 7 days, sorted by stars) from GitHub Search API with retry on 403/429 and 1-hour Redis cache\n- **Learnings:**\n  - GitHub has no official \"trending\" API. The standard workaround is the search endpoint with `q=created:>{7-days-ago}&sort=stars&order=desc` — this is what most trending aggregators use.\n  - GitHub's unauthenticated search API rate limit is 10 requests/minute (stricter than the 60 req/hour general API limit). The `Retry-After` header should be honored when present before falling back to exponential backoff.\n  - `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` header is recommended by GitHub docs for forward compatibility with API versioning.\n  - Repo owner's `avatar_url` makes a good `thumbnailUrl` — it's always present and CDN-served.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback pattern as HackerNews module — keeps the architecture consistent across all data sources.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-007\n- What was implemented: Reddit data source integration fetching top 5 hot posts from r/programming, r/webdev, r/javascript, r/typescript with NSFW/removed post filtering, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/reddit.ts` - `fetchRedditArticles()` using Reddit JSON API with multi-subreddit `+` syntax, combined sorting by score, NSFW/removed filtering, and Article type mapping with metadata (subreddit, upvotes, comments, author)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Reddit's public JSON API works by appending `.json` to any URL — no OAuth needed for read-only access. However, a descriptive `User-Agent` header is required or requests may get 429'd.\n  - Multi-subreddit syntax (`r/A+B+C+D/hot.json`) fetches a merged listing in a single request — Reddit handles the cross-subreddit ranking server-side.\n  - Reddit's `thumbnail` field uses string sentinels (`\"self\"`, `\"default\"`, `\"nsfw\"`, `\"spoiler\"`) instead of `null` when no image is available. Must check for `http://` or `https://` prefix to validate.\n  - We fetch `limit=25` and filter/sort client-side to ensure we have 5 quality posts after removing NSFW, removed, and low-engagement items.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as HackerNews and GitHub modules — architecture stays consistent.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-008\n- What was implemented: Tech News RSS feed integration aggregating articles from The Verge, Ars Technica, and TechCrunch using `rss-parser`, with Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), graceful XML parsing error handling, and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/rss.ts` - `fetchRssArticles()` fetching and aggregating top 5 articles (sorted by publish date) from 3 RSS feeds using `Promise.allSettled()` for independent failure handling, with cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n  - `package.json` - Added `rss-parser` dependency (v3.13.0)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `rss-parser` (v3.13.0) ships with built-in TypeScript types (`index.d.ts`). No `@types/rss-parser` needed. The `Parser.Item` type exposes `isoDate` (ISO 8601 string) which is more reliable for sorting than `pubDate` (RFC 2822 format varies across feeds).\n  - `rss-parser`'s `parseURL()` uses Node's `http/https` modules internally with its own timeout handling. The `timeout` option in the constructor is in milliseconds and applies per-feed.\n  - `Promise.allSettled()` is critical for multi-feed aggregation — one feed timing out (e.g., TechCrunch) shouldn't prevent The Verge and Ars Technica articles from being returned. Individual failures are logged as warnings.\n  - RSS `<enclosure>` tag is the standard way feeds include images. Check `enclosure.type?.startsWith(\"image/\")` to filter for image enclosures vs. audio/video.\n  - Context7 doesn't have `rss-parser` docs indexed — the npm package's `index.d.ts` is the best type reference.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-009\n- What was implemented: Hatena Bookmark data source integration fetching top 5 hot technology entries from Hatena Bookmark RSS feed, with bookmark count as engagement score, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/hatena.ts` - `fetchHatenaArticles()` using `rss-parser` with custom field mapping for `hatena:bookmarkcount` and `hatena:imageurl`, sorted by bookmark count, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Hatena Bookmark hot entries RSS is RDF 1.0 format at `https://b.hatena.ne.jp/hotentry/it.rss` (the \"it\" category = technology). Public, no auth needed, no rate limit documented.\n  - `rss-parser`'s `customFields` option maps namespaced XML elements (e.g. `hatena:bookmarkcount`) to flat property names on item objects. Requires a generic type parameter on `Parser<Feed, Item>` to get TypeScript typing for the custom fields.\n  - Hatena's `hatena:imageurl` provides a thumbnail for most entries — more reliable than trying to extract from `<enclosure>` (which Hatena's RDF feed doesn't include).\n  - Entries are sorted by bookmark count (descending) rather than date — hot entries are already recent, and bookmark count is a better indicator of community interest.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-010\n- What was implemented: Bluesky data source integration fetching top 3 trending tech posts from Bluesky's public AT Protocol API using `searchPosts` with `sort=top`, mapped to Article type with engagement metadata, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/bluesky.ts` - `fetchBlueskyArticles()` using `app.bsky.feed.searchPosts` public endpoint with tech-related query, `sort=top` for popular posts, AT URI→web URL conversion, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Bluesky has no official \"trending posts\" API. The `app.bsky.unspecced.getTrends` and `getTrendingTopics` endpoints return topic names/metadata, not actual post content. Best approach for trending posts: `searchPosts` with `sort=top` and relevant keywords.\n  - The public Bluesky AppView at `public.api.bsky.app` serves unauthenticated read-only requests. No API key or OAuth needed for `searchPosts`.\n  - AT Protocol URIs follow `at://{did}/{collection}/{rkey}` format. To build a web-clickable URL: extract the rkey (last URI segment) and combine with author handle → `bsky.app/profile/{handle}/post/{rkey}`.\n  - Bluesky posts have no separate `title` field — the post `text` (up to 300 chars) is the entire content. Truncating to ~100 chars for title and ~200 chars for excerpt provides a good card display.\n  - `PostView` includes `likeCount`, `repostCount`, `replyCount` as optional integers (may be undefined if zero). Default to 0 with `?? 0`.\n  - Author `avatar` URL from the API makes a serviceable `thumbnailUrl` since Bluesky posts often lack embedded images in the search response.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-011\n- What was implemented: YouTube trending data source integration fetching top 3 trending Science & Technology videos from YouTube Data API v3, with view count as engagement score, ISO 8601 duration parsing, Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), quota-exceeded detection, and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/youtube.ts` - `fetchYouTubeArticles()` using `videos.list` with `chart=mostPopular` and `videoCategoryId=28`, maps to Article type with metadata (channel, views, likes, comments, duration), cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - `videos.list` with `chart=mostPopular` costs only 1 quota unit per call, vs `search.list` at 100 units. Critical for staying within the 10,000 units/day limit — 1-hour cache means ~24 calls/day = 24 units total.\n  - `videoCategoryId=28` is \"Science & Technology\" — YouTube category IDs are fixed numbers, not configurable strings. Full list available via `videoCategories.list` endpoint.\n  - YouTube `contentDetails.duration` uses ISO 8601 format (`PT#H#M#S`). Regex parsing with optional groups handles all variants: `PT1H2M34S`, `PT12M5S`, `PT45S`.\n  - `statistics` fields (`viewCount`, `likeCount`, `commentCount`) are returned as strings, not numbers. Must `Number()` convert them.\n  - API key is passed as `key=` query parameter (not in headers). Missing `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` env var is handled gracefully — returns empty array without throwing, same as the Redis/DB build-time safety pattern.\n  - Quota exceeded errors return HTTP 403 with `quotaExceeded` in the JSON body — detected by checking the response text before throwing.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-012\n- What was implemented: ProductHunt data source integration fetching today's top 5 product launches via ProductHunt API v2 (GraphQL), mapped to Article type with metadata (votes, tagline, topics), Upstash Redis caching (1-hour TTL), and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/producthunt.ts` - `fetchProductHuntArticles()` using PH GraphQL API with `posts(first: 5, order: VOTES, postedAfter: today)` query, Bearer token auth, Relay-style edge/node response mapping, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - ProductHunt API v2 is GraphQL-only at `api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql`. No REST endpoint for fetching posts. Requires a Developer Token (Bearer auth), obtained from the PH developer dashboard.\n  - The `posts` query supports `order: VOTES` and `postedAfter: DateTime!` to fetch today's top products. `postedAfter` expects an ISO 8601 timestamp (midnight UTC today) to scope results to today's launches.\n  - PH uses Relay-style pagination: `posts.edges[].node` wraps each post. Topics are nested the same way: `topics.edges[].node.name`.\n  - `thumbnail` is nullable (returns `{ url: string } | null`). Some new products haven't uploaded a thumbnail yet. Using optional chaining `node.thumbnail?.url ?? undefined`.\n  - Env var `PRODUCTHUNT_API_TOKEN` follows the same conditional guard pattern as YouTube's `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` — returns empty array when missing, no build-time failures.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-013\n- What was implemented: Weather widget data source fetching current weather from OpenWeatherMap API with typed `WeatherData` interface, 30-minute Upstash Redis caching, city parameter (default: Tokyo), and graceful degradation when API key is missing\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/weather.ts` - `fetchWeather(city?)` returning `WeatherData | null` using OWM current-weather endpoint (`/data/2.5/weather`), cache-first + stale-fallback pattern with 30-minute TTL\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Weather module returns a dedicated `WeatherData` interface (not `Article[]`) because weather data powers a sidebar widget, not article cards. The `Article` type's fields (score, externalId, source) don't map semantically to weather data.\n  - Return type is `WeatherData | null` (not `WeatherData[]`) since there's only one result. `null` lets the UI distinguish \"unavailable\" from \"loaded\" — unlike article sources where `[]` is a valid empty state.\n  - OpenWeatherMap free-tier API key is passed via `appid=` query parameter. `units=metric` returns Celsius directly — no client-side conversion needed.\n  - OWM's `weather` array may contain multiple conditions but [0] is the primary. Icon codes like `\"01d\"` / `\"10n\"` map to OWM's CDN: `openweathermap.org/img/wn/{icon}@2x.png`.\n  - Cache TTL is 30 minutes (vs 1 hour for article sources) per PRD spec — weather changes more frequently than news rankings.\n  - Same env-var guard pattern as YouTube/ProductHunt — returns `null` when `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` is unset, no build-time failures.\n  - PRD also mentions caching in the `weather_cache` DB table. The current implementation caches in Redis only. DB caching will be integrated during the edition builder (US-015) when database writes are orchestrated.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-014\n- What was implemented: Stock market widget data source fetching current index data for Nikkei 225, S&P 500, and NASDAQ from Yahoo Finance v7 quote API, with market-hours-aware Upstash Redis caching (15 min during trading hours, 6 hours after close), typed `StockData` interface, and stale-cache fallback\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/lib/sources/stocks.ts` - `fetchStockData()` returning `StockData[]` using Yahoo Finance batch quote endpoint with 3 symbols (`^N225`, `^GSPC`, `^IXIC`), market-hours-aware TTL selection, cache-first + stale-fallback pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Yahoo Finance's public v7 quote endpoint (`query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote`) supports batch symbol queries via comma-separated `symbols` parameter — all 3 indices in a single request. No API key required.\n  - Alpha Vantage free tier limits to 25 calls/day and 5/min — impractical for 3 indices with 15-minute refresh. Yahoo Finance has no documented rate limit for the quote endpoint.\n  - Yahoo Finance returns `regularMarketPrice`, `regularMarketChange`, `regularMarketChangePercent` as numbers (not strings like YouTube's API). No type coercion needed.\n  - Market-hours-aware TTL requires checking UTC time against two timezone windows: JPX trades 09:00–15:00 JST (00:00–06:00 UTC) and NYSE/NASDAQ trades 09:30–16:00 ET (13:30–21:00 UTC covering both EST and EDT). Using a broad window avoids DST detection complexity.\n  - Index symbols use caret prefix: `^N225` (Nikkei), `^GSPC` (S&P 500), `^IXIC` (NASDAQ Composite). The `shortName` field provides a readable name as fallback.\n  - Like weather, stock data returns a dedicated `StockData[]` interface (not `Article[]`) since it powers a sidebar widget, not article cards. Returns `[]` (not `null`) because multiple entries is a natural array state.\n  - Same cache-first + stale-fallback + fire-and-forget `cacheSet` pattern as all other source modules. PRD also mentions `stock_cache` DB table — DB persistence will be integrated during US-015 edition builder.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-06 - US-015\n- What was implemented: Cron job for automated edition data collection. Creates `/api/cron/collect` GET route handler that fetches all 8 article sources + weather + stocks in parallel via `Promise.allSettled()`, normalizes scores to 0-100, creates a draft edition record, saves top-N articles per source to the database, caches widget data (weather/stocks), and marks the edition as published. Configured Vercel Cron in `vercel.json` for 06:00 and 17:00 Asia/Tokyo (21:00 UTC and 08:00 UTC).\n- Files changed:\n  - `src/app/api/cron/collect/route.ts` - Cron route handler with parallel fetching, score normalization, DB persistence, idempotency check, CRON_SECRET auth guard, and structured logging\n  - `vercel.json` - Vercel Cron configuration with two schedules (morning/evening editions)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Vercel Cron Jobs invoke endpoints via **GET** requests (not POST). Using `export async function POST()` would result in 405 when the cron fires.\n  - Vercel automatically sends `CRON_SECRET` env var as `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header. Checking `authorization !== Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` is the standard auth guard pattern.\n  - Vercel cron expressions use UTC only. Japan (Asia/Tokyo = UTC+9) doesn't observe DST, so the conversion is fixed: `06:00 JST` = `21:00 UTC` (cron: `0 21 * * *`), `17:00 JST` = `08:00 UTC` (cron: `0 8 * * *`).\n  - `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: \"Asia/Tokyo\"` is the cleanest way to get current JST hour/date in a serverless environment without timezone libraries. Using `en-CA` locale for date formatting gives ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) directly.\n  - Score normalization uses fixed ranges per source rather than percentile-ranking within each batch. This provides stable, predictable scoring even when batch sizes vary.\n  - Idempotency guard (checking for existing edition with same type+date before insert) prevents duplicate editions on Vercel cron retries.\n  - Weather and stock data are widgets, not articles - they're cached in Redis under `edition:widgets` key rather than inserted into the articles table.\n---\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":254,"oldLines":3,"newStart":254,"newLines":15,"lines":["   - Idempotency guard (checking for existing edition with same type+date before insert) prevents duplicate editions on Vercel cron retries.","   - Weather and stock data are widgets, not articles - they're cached in Redis under `edition:widgets` key rather than inserted into the articles table."," ---","+","+## 2026-02-07 - US-016","+- What was implemented: Reusable ArticleCard client component displaying thumbnail (with Image fallback), 2-line clamped title, source brand color badge, relative time, engagement score, and hover-visible action buttons (bookmark/share/hide).

No broken image icons.","+  - `Record<ArticleSource, string>` for `SOURCE_COLORS` and `SOURCE_LABELS` maps gives compile-time exhaustiveness — if a new source is added to the `ArticleSource` union type, TypeScript flags missing entries immediately.","+  - `group-hover:opacity-100 group-focus-within:opacity-100` on the action button container ensures buttons appear on both mouse hover and keyboard focus traversal — covers all interaction modes.","+  - Article `metadata` is `Record<string, unknown>` — the card reads `createdAt` and `publishDate` with type assertions since metadata shape varies per source. Downstream stories (US-022) may standardize this.","+---"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
